REFUGE OF OPPRESSION

From the Boston Journal.
THE LIBERATOR.
It is some time since we had a good hearty scoring down from the Liberator. We used to Calculate upon such an infliction about once in six weeks, and had come to regard it with philosophic indifference. But we have Sadly missed this periodic scolding of late. We have been much in the position of the man who mourned for the loss of his wife, who was a notorious scold. He had become so habituated to being scolded that the world seemed joyless without it. But our common scold is not dead. It has only slept. and we are this week again treated to a hearty ‘blowing up,’ and lest we should again be neglected for so long a time, we shall depart from our usual course, and acknowledge the Infliction Our offence is, opposition to the bill to: nullify the fugitive slave law, which Mr. Garrison acknowledges to be unconstitutional. For standing by the constitution, we are treated to as many abusive epithets as could conveniently be crowded into half a column, denounced as ‘neither for slavery nor liberty, neither for God nor the adversary,’ and, to cap the climax generally are flatly informed that ‘it is not at all creditable to the intelligence or virtue of the people The Journal has the largest circulation of any daily paper in New England, and most money.’ 
We do not propose to waste any arguments upon the Liberator, for it will not listen to counsels of moderation and reason. But there is one observation which we desire to make to those who are ready to trample upon the Constitution, in order to make Massachusetts the refuge for fugitive slaves instead of Canada. Our Constitution is one of compromises. While the Northern States conceded the rendition of fugitives from labor, the Southern States, in deference to the repugnance to slavery which existed at the North, Relinquished the right which they had exercised to import slaves from the coast of Africa. if we openly repudiate our constitutional obligations and nullify the fugitive slave law, how can we require the South to refrain from importing more Slaves? With what consistency can we say to South Carolina and Georgia-the Constitution and the laws prohibit the Slave trade, you shall not reopen it? If Massachusetts passes the bill which has been reported in the Legislature, she must abandon the power which the Constitution has placed in her hands as a confederate State, to suppress the slave trade. We may use moral suasion, it is true, with our brethren of the South, but we cannot insist upon enforcing what is to them an obnoxious provision of the Constitution, while we repudiate another portion of the Constitution which is obnoxious to us Looking upon the question at issue as one of Philanthropy merely. surely it would bean act of folly in the Northern States to repudiate the constitutional obligation to return fugitives from labor, when the result must necessarily be to reproduce all the miseries of the slave trade, and to add tons of thousands to the number of bondsmen in the land.

From the Boston Courier.
MR. GRIFFIN’S BILL.
Quite a number of members of the legislature have tried their hands from same to time upon Perusal<illegible> complications among these, during the present season, is Mr. Geriffin of Malden who may be said in metaphorical language to ‘go the entire figure ‘for that largest liberty of every man, which in practical operation would be totally inconsistent with the liberty of anybody else. Although Mr. Griffin, we believe, is a lawyer, he exhibits not only an ingenuous innocence of the principles which he at the foundation of all law, but also an. Apparent unconsciousness that there is any virtue in the Constitution and statute-book of the United States. By the bill of Mr. Griffin, the act of Congress passed in 1793, and that of 1850, respecting persons escaping from the service of their masters, are absolutely repealed. Any citizen of the United States who should venture, under the provisions of those acts, to arrest, imprison, or carry out of the Common wealth any such escaping persons, is to be himself imprisoned therefor, during a period of from three to twenty years, according to the aggravation, we suppose, with which he exercises his legal rights by force of the aforesaid acts. Can human folly and Madness go further than this? Or is it only that Mr. Griffin thinks on this bubble to ride into Congress, and there, the inflated wind-bag having burst, to subside, like others chosen on the most ferocious grounds, into exemplary tameness,-or like still others to cultivate highly affectionate terms with the must salamandrian of the fire-eaters themselves? We know not-but such things have happened often enough.
Still, the introduction of this bill leads us to consider for a moment its utility, that is, its practical effects and operation, if it should pass. A little exercise of the imagination, by way of forecast, so as to see consequences, is often useful in a legislator, We will suppose. Then, the new Personal Liberty Bill to have become a law of Massachusetts. It is not impossible that some very strong-minded slaveholder may come here in the course of time, in pursuit of his fugitive domestic, though no instance has occurred, we believe, for the space of four or five years. He will apply to a Commissioner of the United States, who will grant a warrant, of course, as he has no choice in the matter, and will, perhaps, conceive it his duty to obey acts of the United States which, being clearly constitutional, even Under the decision of the Supreme Court of our own State, he will judge to be of paramount authority to a law of the State, Which his common sense teaches him is and must be unconstitutional. He will therefore grant a warrant. The Marshal, being equally without choice in the matter, will execute the warrant. If the process of habeas corpus should be applied to the case, the Court before which it is made returnable must necessarily restore the fugitive to the custody of the Marshal, Supposing the Proceedings are regular also, under the settled law of the State, as adjudicated upon by its Supreme Court. Can the Marshal, or the Commissioner, then, be punished by imprisonment even for the shortest period provided by Mr. Griffin, namely, only three years for acting in conformity with their duty in obedience to the law? Or if held to trial, and convicted by a Jury of strongly developed colored propeasities, would they not be forthwith. discharged by the Court under the law, and the statute thus proposed by Mr. Griffin be rendered null and void? If such a result may be foreseen, the futility of Passing such a Personal Liberty Bill becomes readily manifest.
Indeed, we know not how Mr. Griffin can reach his object all, even were it not for the somewhat insuperable obstacles to which we have alluded. But putting this class of impediments aside, what would or could be the result of attempting to execute such a statute of the Commonwealth? We cannot but think that the Government of the United States, if the administration should be in the hands of those who have any sort of spirit or deference for law, would scarcely fail to protect its citizens from such an outrage as the bill now proposed contemplates.
<c02>
Boston might in such a case be placed in the attitude of Charleston in nullifying times. For our own part, we have no desire to see it garrisoned with United States troops, or to behold a line of men-of-war drawn up for hostile purposes in its harbor. But we suppose the United States would see that its laws were executed, and those who executed them saved from harm,-and the passage of such a bill as that now before the Legislature, it is evident, would place us in precisely the same relations to it that the Mormons recently held, and justly exposed to the consequences of rebellion. And though we have no belief that blood would be shed,-since our abolition brethren are not fighting characters, and the main body of our citizens are not disposed for nullification, -yet we cannot but think that such a Personal Liberty Bill, if passed into a law, which would be no law, would, from a variety of untoward causes, remain a dead letter upon the statute-book. What nonsense there is in every such forth-putting effort of impracticable and unreasoning zeal!

From the Boston Post.
MASSACHUSETTS AND THE CONSTITUTION.
Deeply is it to be deplored that public opinion should be so stolid at the traitorous designs of the sectional party which now rules Massachusetts. We have cited and commented upon the disunion law proposed by the Committee on Federal Relations. It would seem that this act does not go far enough; for one of the trusted leaders of the party has proposed another act more thorough in its character; more direct in its application to laws of Congress, more practical. To show clearly the unconstitutionality of the proposed legislation, it is only necessary to cite the words of the Federal Constitution and the words of the proposed law. The Constitution says,
‘No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.’
We now cite two sections of the act proposed in the House by Mr. Griffin, of Maiden,-who is a lawyer, and a favorite Republican orator and leader:
Sect. 2. Whoever shall arrest, imprison, or carry out of this Commonwealth, or shall attempt to arrest, imprison, or carry out of this Commonwealth, under or by virtue of an act of Congress, approved the 12th of February, 1793, entitled ‘An Act Respecting Fugitives from Justice and Persons Escaping from the Service of their Masters,’ or under or by virtue of an act of congress, approved Sept. 18, 1850, entitled ‘An Act to Amend and Supplementary to an Act Respecting Fugitives from Justice and Persons escaping from the Service of their Masters,’ any person, for the alleged reason that such person owes service or labor as a slave to any person, shall be punished by imprisonment in the State Prison for a term not less than three nor more than twenty years.
Sec. 3. Whoever shall arrest, imprison or carry out of this Commonwealth, or shall attempt to arrest, imprison, or carry out of this Commonwealth, either without law or under or by virtue of any law now existing, other than the acts of Congress referred to in the preceding section, any person, for the alleged reason such person owes service or labor as a slave to any party, shall be punished by imprisonment in the State Prison for the term of his natural life, or any term of years not less than ten.
There would seem to be no occasion for argument as to the meaning of this act; the purpose frankly avowed in it is to oppose a law of the United States; to violate the very Constitution which legislators swear, on taking their oaths of office as legislators, to support. If there be honesty in the party which supports such proposition, on the occurrence of a fugitive slave case, there can hardly fail to be, here in our midst, a collision between this State and the United States.
Will not such nefarious propositions as these arouse patriotic citizens to a sense of the duty which they owe to themselves and to their country? In view of this palpable violation of the Constitution of our country, what becomes of the protestations which Republicans make, that they do not mean to deprive the South of any of its legal rights? It is all a piece of hypocrisy. They do mean to violate these rights. They war on slaveholders, on slavery, on the South, on co-equal sister States of this Union, and such war is suicidal to every instinct of country. It is enough to say that these propositions as to legislation are flatly unconstitutional; and this should rouse against them the patriotic element of the community.

THE MASSACHUSETTS DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
The Boston Post copies and publishes as a leaded editorial, the following atrocious stuff from the Worcester Bay State, gives it the most prominent place in the editorial columns of the Post, and of course adopts and endorses it. The Worcester organ says:
“The Constitution of the United States, in clear and precise terms, declares:
‘No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, bat shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.’
From this language there can be no escape. African servitude is known to the laws of one half of the Republic as, at the time of the formation of the Constitution, it was common to all. The negro slave who runs away from Virginia, absconds from service due under the laws of that Commonwealth. When he sets foot upon the soil of Massachusetts, he commits a trespass, if we choose to regard it as such; and at any rate is guilty of an unwarrantable intrusion. If he will thrust himself where he is not wanted, what right has he to complain if he shares the fate of an interloper? If he throws himself upon our sympathies, what right have we to extend our individual compassion, so far as to allow it to instigate us to a violation of the supreme law? The fugitive slave is such; and being such, cannot, in abolition technology, be a free citizen of our own Commonwealth. He stands upon our soil without permission, uninvited, and in contempt of the laws of the State from which he fled.’(!!!)
THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. Mr. Letcher has written a letter accepting the nomination of the Petersburg Convention for the Governorship of Virginia. On the subject of Slavery he says:
‘To avoid all misapprehension, I state in language distinct and emphatic, that I regard the institution of domestic slavery, existing in Virginia and the other slaveholding States, morally, socially and politically right. I trust that I will be found as ready to defend the institution, and to resist all encroachments upon it, as any man in the commonwealth. In doing this, I will be defending and protecting my own interests and property, as well as the interests and property of my fellow citizens.’

MINISTEIAL TROUBLES AND ANTISLAVERY AGITATION.
[From an unpublished Anti-Slavery Work.]
‘What became of your dismissed minister?’ said Elder Shiltey. 
‘Well, he had a large family, and had to do something for bread. So, finding churches don’t like ministers that carry things too far, he took to peddling books and preaching on temperance; that was the last I heard of him.’
‘Why, don’t you remember,’ said Mrs. Seely, ‘that we heard he had gone down East some where, was teaching school in winter, and working with his boys in summer?’
‘I believe I did hear something of that kind,’ said the deacon, but no matter; he hurt his usefulness. Still, the elder had some good things about him, but never seemed to know where to stop when once agoing. He was never careful enough upon exciting subjects. Had he been prudent, if he would hare heard to advice, he might have been with us yet. He knew very well that the church was really a temperance church, but the elder wanted something more-I don’t know what. We passed a resolution at a church meeting in favor of temperance, but that was not enough.’ 
‘He must have been an unreasonable man,’ said Shiltey, with ill-concealed irony. ‘to seek for more than a church resolution against intemperance.’ 
‘We thought so,’ replied the deacon, ‘we thought so.’
‘You had peace, I suppose, after he left you!’ said Mr. Shiltey. 
‘Well, for a short time. You know if the devil can’t work against the church one way, he will another. We soon got into deep waters, and have been in them nearly ever since. When the elder left us, we were destitute for some months, being determined to get the right sort of a man, if it were a possible thing. By-and-by, we heard of an Elder Whitely; none of us knew any thing about him, but he was recommended to us by the agent of the Bible Society; and, being a total stranger, not likely to be a party man. He was a good preacher, had only a wife and one child; and his wife. We were told, could earn her own living by tailoring. Well, to make the story short, we gave him a call, and he became our pastor. Pretty soon, the church began to come up, the congregation increased, and there were evident signs of an outpouring. But yon know, brother Shiltey, the devil is always on the look-out; and the cloven foot appeared among us once more in the shape of abolitionism.’ 
The old grandmother groaned deeply; the deacon continued: 
‘A lecturer came round; wanted the use of the meeting-house, which the trustees very wisely refused, thinking he would leave the place without lecturing; but no, he got the school-room; and Elder Whitely attended, to the grievance of many brethren. I would not have you infer from this, brother Shiltey, that we are not as a church abolitionists, properly speaking. As far back as the year eighteen hundred and, I think, thirty-six, we took a vote of the church that slavery was an evil, and a very unfortunate thing for the country; and this cleared our skirts. But we knew that the whole subject was itself exciting, and we knew it was being carried too far, and we knew, moreover, that Infidels and Universalists, no-church-men and all, were becoming abolitionists. Well, brother Shiltey, it was understood that the real object of those men was the overthrow of the church, and the dissolution of the Union. So, as Christians, we could give no countenance to such a work. However, Elder Whitely attended the lectures, and actually subscribed for an abolition paper. We said nothing, but just thought we would wait, and let the thing work. It did work, sure enough, and soon enough; abolition hints could be detected in the sermons, and by-and-by out comes the elder with ‘whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them.’ This was followed with many a hard saying about the bleeding slave, about man-stealers, and murderers, and the guilt of churches. We admonished the elder, but it appeared only to make him worse and worse; the church would not come out, and the congregation began to fall away. We saw plainly that the elder’s usefulness was destroyed, and, after prayer and consultation, we dismissed him.’ 
‘And what became of him?’ said Mr. Shiltey.
‘Yon will see him to-morrow,’ said the deacon, ‘for he still comes to church, and when he can, puts in a word about slavery.’
‘Then he remained in the neighborhood?
‘Finally, he did; after spending about a year looking out for a place to preach; going clear to the State of Ohio; but found few churches that wanted an abolition minister. The elder never removed his family; so when he came back, he got hold of a little piece of land, and contrived to make some kind of a living; still talking about abolition, although he has lost his influence now. It would have been a great mercy for the church if he had lost it sooner, for he ruined our next pastor, as nice a man at first as any church could desire. But one sinner destroys much good. Elder Dunn, our next minister, it is said, was a warm-hearted preacher, and it was not long before there appeared signs for good. Elder Whitely had just got back from Ohio, when the interest commenced in the church. We knew he would be likely to attend, so we put brother Dunn on his guard. Well, as we expected, he came to meeting, and Elder Dunn had to tell him twice, in the course of one evening, to sit down. ‘If you wish to talk about religion,’ said brother Dunn, ‘we will with pleasure listen; but if you want to talk about abolition, you must go to some more proper ‘place. What have we to do about slavery?’ continued Elder Dunn; if you think slaveholding a tin, go to the slaveholder, and tell him so.’
‘What did he say to that?’ inquired Mr. Shiltey. 
‘Just what might have been expected from a man possessed with seven devils. He shook his fist in the face of Elder Dunn, and wd, “You are the slave- 
<c04>
holder, sir; you and the church are by no means guiltless of your brother’s blood; God, who is just, will require it at your hands.” After saying this, in a very angry, unchristian-like tone, he took his hat and walked. “Thank the good Lord,” said brother Dunn, “the enemy has fled; we can now sit together in heavenly places.” And we did hare a precious season that evening. We had a solemn time; no fewer than seven precious souls came forward, asking the prayers of the saints, and saying, with tears, “What shall we do to be saved?” Well, five of those poor souls were set at liberty on the spot, in answer to earnest prayer sent up on their behalf. The next evening, we had a copious shower of divine grace, and many were convicted, while four were hopefully converted. In fact, the village seemed to be moved by a mighty rushing wind, and great grace was upon the church. Whitely never came nigh our evening meetings any more, but every Sunday he and his family attended church. He said nothing to any one on the subject of slavery, and we were in hopes he had begun to see his error. About twenty conversions had taken place, and all were going along in perfect harmony; although the special interest had now subsided, still we were happy, enjoying its fruits. Pretty soon it was observed that Elder Whitely appeared to be on friendly terms with brother Dunn, and had been seen more than once giving him papers. Some of us had our fears, and not without reason; for, on Thanksgiving day, the elder made a clean sweep of both Church and State-preached the hottest abolition sermon that we had ever had. All that Elder Whitely had preached was not a circumstance to that sermon. I tell you it was the hardest kind of feed, that sermon was. A number of the brethren met at my house that evening. We consulted together, and saw that the case required prompt action. We all felt as if we had been abused, and did not feel like paying a man for insulting us from our own pulpit. The business was got along with in short order, and Elder Dunn was discharged. When the committee presented his dismission, he begged the privilege of speaking once more before the church-said he had done wrong, and wished to make confession. Well, of course, we were glad to hear him say so, and we readily complied with his request.’
‘So he confessed that he had sinned?’ said Elder Shiltey. 
‘Yes, he confessed that he had been very guilty in; not showing to the church her unparalleled wickedness in beholding with so much indifference the gigantic sin and sum of all sins. But,’ he continued, ‘I was myself ignorant, and for this cause I pray God that I may find forgiveness and mercy. By false reasoning and unhallowed prejudice, I shut out the light. I was blind, but now I see.’ He then exhorted us all to speedy repentance, and a good deal more he said upon the subject. I must allow it was a very feeling sermon, and it made some abolitionists; but the church could not get along with them, and most have been excluded. However, the church did not lose much by their exclusion, for they were not the sort that paid much to the support of the ministry.’
‘Well,’ said Mr. Shiltey, ‘what became of Elder Dunn?’
‘Like all other ultra-abolition<illegible>, no church wanted his talent. You see ministers<illegible> known all over when they ain’t sound, and churches are getting far more cautious than they used to be. Elder Dunn spent some six months going from place to place; at last he took to doctoring, he having studied for a doctor before he was converted; and I guess he manages to live along, giving abolition lectures now and then.’
‘I see,’ said Elder Shiltey, ‘you have had trouble enough with the peculiar institution.’
‘Don’t it beat all,’ said the deacon, ‘that we of the North should be so worried with a thing that we have nothing to do with?’
‘Slavery has .long arms,’ replied Shiltey; but checked himself, wishing to hear more before discovering the cloven foot, as the deacon called it.
‘The next man we had was Elder Crossburn, who finished his labors with us four weeks ago. Brother Crossburn was a man of the right stamp. We should have been glad to had him remain with us, but the Master had other work for him. He received an appointment as agent of-Society, and we could not blame him for leaving u?, as he had a large family, and could get twice as much from the Society as from us. He was a very prudent man. Elder Crossburn would have nothing to do with topics that divide and distract the feelings of brethren; his one great object being the salvation of sinners, and the conversion of the heathen to the religion of Jesus Christ.
‘A most glorious object,’ said Shiltey.
‘Brother Crossburn,’ continued the deacon, ‘says, and no doubt he knows, that the more that is done about slavery at the North, the longer before the slaves will be set free, and the harder is it for them now. The best friend that the slave has is the man that says nothing about slavery. This everlasting talk only irritates the South, and you can’t drive men no more than yon can hogs; it can’t natural to be drove.’
‘And yet,’ said Shiltey, ‘the wicked are driven away in their wickedness.’ ‘He that, being often reproved, hardeneth his heart, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.’
‘In a scriptural sense,’ said the deacon, ‘I suppose it’s just so; but I speak of temporal things.’
The grandmother, who had been all attention, and closely watching the face of the minister during the conversation, now said, ‘I hope this is not a nigger preacher; I hope we shan’t bear any more about the petty creatures, now when we have got a figerative law that is to carry them where they belong.’
‘A fugitive law, grandmother,’ said the daughter, scarcely able to restrain herself.
‘Well.’ said the aged disciple, ‘I suppose it’s the same thing. Elder Greenall used to say the law was shadow or figure of good things to come and the good thing has come-and I have lived to see it, if they carry them all back, I’m sure.’ She added, after a short pause, ‘I don’t wish the turnol creatures any harm, but they haw no business to make such doings among the elect.’
‘Well, well, mother,’ said the deacon, ‘we are not going to be discouraged; the Lord will take care of his chosen.’
<c05>
‘In the world ye shall have tribulation; when the enemy comes in like a flood, the sea, and waves-’ 
The last part of the sentence was lost as the old, lady hastily left the room.
Mr. Shiltey felt strongly inclined to make a clean breast of it, at once, when the deacon’s wife, who had thus far taken no part in the conversation, said-
‘I suppose I’m not like other folks; I think a good deal of some niggers; I think some of them are real smart, and ought to be treated kindly in their place’ 
‘Sartin,’ said the deacon, ‘sartin, but the plaguy creatures don’t know their place; treat them kindly, and you just spoil them. Look at Sal Daily, she was treated kindly by every body, and what did it come to?’
‘Sal Daily,’ said Mrs. Seely, and it was evident her wrath was rising, ‘Sal Daily was a smart, active wench-could handle herself better than some white folks that I could name. When she worked for me, I seldom had to find fault, and she was just as neat as wax, keeping every thing neat and in its place.’
‘Very well,’ said the deacon. ‘Yon know Sal had a good deal of white in her, may be two-thirds, just black enough to spoil her. Every body treated Sal well, and you know how it ended.’
‘Yes,’ replied the wife, ‘I know how it ended.’ ‘Was she a member of the church? ’said Shiltey. ‘Well,’ said the deacon, ‘I suppose she a-kind-a belonged.’
‘I know how it ended, Mr. Seely. I know how it ended, and I hope that rascal-rich man’s son though he be-will come to as bad an end,’ said Mrs. Seely. ‘I don’t hope, that is, I don’t wish any harm to anybody-I hope I don’t,’ she laid in a low tone. But, I think that man will get his pay in his own kind yet. Sal Daily was just as good in the sight of God as he is, and, may-be, a little better. Treated kindly!’ she added, while her lip curled, and her eye-which was really a fine eye-flashed a little, ‘I tell you what, Mr. Seely, if that man comes into the church, as you tell about, I goes out for one, that you may depend upon. What care I for his money? His money can’t bring back poor Sal Daily. A great help to the church, you say; it’s my opinion the church has had too much of that kind of help already. If he is rich, why don’t he go and take his own child out of the county-house?’
‘We don’t know that the child is his,’ said the deacon; ‘yon know he never acknowledged it; all we have is Sal’s word for it.’ 
Deacon Seely,’ said the wife,-and she fixed upon her husband’s face a look of such searching earnestness as brought that gentleman’s eyes to the carpet,- ‘Deacon Seely, do you think that a woman, a mother in the agonies of death, would speak falsely about the father of her child? Shame on you, Deacon Seely, if you can believe such a thing! Sal Daily never went to the judgment with a lie in her month. Poor thing, she was a truthful girl. I’m satisfied of that and the rascal-’
‘Hush, hush, Mrs. Seely; you know the thing is all got along with now-nearly forgotten. I have such charity for Mr. Byner; I do think in my heart that he has met with a change-been the happy subject of renewing grace. The man is very gifted, and I should not wonder if, by-and-by, he should be found a chosen vessel of the Lord to carry the glad tidings of salvation to a dying world-should not wonder at all. As far Sal Daily, you know, Mrs. Seely. I have always said she ought not to have been neglected, however great her fault. You know I have always said so; haint I? I think she might have lived, if she had been properly eared for.’
If I had known her circumstances,’ said Mrs. Seely, wench or no wench, she should not have suffered. But the poor thing was afraid of her life, because he threatened to kill her. I tell yon again, he will get his pay. I don’t believe a bit in his religion, if he does pay the highest subscription for the minister. I don’t care if he does pray and cry, and talk in the meetings about being filled with the Spirit. I don’t care, Deacon Seely; I believe he is a limb of the devil, after all. When he publicly confuses himself the destroyer of Sal Daily, and the father of her child; when he takes that child home to his own house, puts it under the care of his lady wife, and treats it as his first-born, then I’ll believe in his religion.’
‘Well, Mrs. Seely, you stand up bravely for the negroes,’ said the deacon. ‘It’s my opinion that the word will come to an end before yon get satisfied about the religion of Mr. Byner. There is reason in all things, Mrs. Seely-remember that.’
‘I don’t stand up for the negroes, Mr. Seely, said the lady, ‘all the negroes that ever I saw could stand up for themselves, just as good as some white folks can. But I tell you, Mr. Seely, what I stand up for; I stand up for rights, whether white or black; right is right, any how. And more than all this, Mr. Seely, I don’t want to have the mean villany of men covered up. He is the meanest dog of dogs that will take the advantage of a woman. White or black, Mr. Seely; white or black, I don’t eve. And if that be standing up for negroes, then stand it is.’ ‘Come in,’ said the deacon, in answer to a knock at the door. And the next moment, Elder Shiltey was introduced to brother Bexly and Mr. Sterns. ‘We heard that the elder had arrived,’ said Bexly, ‘so we thought we would run in a moment, and say, how do you do?’
‘Very glad to see you,’ said Shiltey, very glad to see you. Hope we shall get better acquainted.’
‘Brother Shiltey,’ said the deacon, ‘brother Bexly and Mr. Sterns are the other members of the hiring committee; perhaps they would like to convene with you upon the subject of becoming our pastor.’
‘Would it not be well to wait till you hear me preach?’ said the minister; ‘I might not please you.’
‘I guess yon can preach a little,’ said Bexly; at least, brother Leland says you can. We don’t, of course, mean to come to any agreement now; it is possible you might not like us; best to try us a little. It might not be amiss, however, to hear your general views upon things in a general way,’ continued Bexly. ‘I suppose you are like all other good ministers of Jesus Christ, a peace man, a temperance man and a sound anti-slavery man?’
‘All three, I think,’ replied the minister, ‘all three.’
‘That’s just what we want,’ said Bexly. ‘If these things be to you, and abound, they make you that ye

shall neither be barren nor unfruitful. And, again. Blessed are the peace-makers; follow peace with all men; seek after the things that make for peace. And if it be possible, as much as in you Men, live peaceably with all men. And, again, he will speak peace to his people, and pray for the peace of Jerusalem-’
‘And again,’ said the elder; ‘there is no peace. with my God, to the wicked-the way of peace have they not known-they say peace, peace, when there is no peace-I come not to send peace, but a sword.’
‘It is just so,’ said Bexly, ‘the wicked flee when no man pursueth, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.’
‘It appears to me,’ said Mr. Sterna, ‘that all this is going round about-not exactly to the point; it may all be very well in its place. I think the Bible says, “A place for every thing, and every thing in its place.” I might go on quoting Scripture, but that would never bring us to an understanding. I am acting for others; and if the elder would not be offended, I should like to ask a few simple questions.’
‘No offence,’ said Mr. Shiltey, ‘I hold myself ready to answer proper questions on all occasions.’
‘What are your real sentiments on slavery?’ inquired Mr. Sterns.
‘That it is the sum of all villany,’ replied the minister.
‘That is exactly my opinion,’ said Bexly. 
‘And mine,’ responded the deacon. 
Sterns looked at Bexly and the deacon, apparently a good deal pooled, but finally concluded they were playing possum, and so went on.
‘We all agree that slavery is wrong, or a sin, if you like, but it’s not a sin of ours. The North won’t have to answer for the sins of the South, if I understand the Bible.’
‘That is about as I view the matter,’ said Bexly ‘every man shall bear his own burden.’
‘Every man shall die for his own sins,’ said the deacon.
‘Every tub shall stand on its own bottom,’ said Sterns.
‘And thou shalt not suffer sin upon thy brother-have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them,’ aid Shiltey.
‘And so I say,’ said Bexly, ‘and so says our church by a vote taken long, long ago. Thank the Lord, we stand straight on that point.’
Sterns again said he was acting for others; for that part of the congregation that could not do their duty by voting-that could not clear their skirts by a show of hands. ‘But, after all, the congregation has a say in the settlement of a minister; and at I am appointed to act for the society part of the church, I wish to be a little more specific; I wish to be faithful to my trust. Now you see, elder, we have had nothing but trouble with abolition ministers for years, and the society will not bear it much longer, that’s certain.’
‘Then you don’t belong to the church?’ said Mr. Shiltey.
‘No, sir, I act for the society, who help support the minister, and I must say plainly they won’t bear it.’
‘They won’t bear to have preaching, against the sum of all villany?’
‘They have had enough of it,’ replied Sterns, ‘and more than enough. Elder Crossburn was well liked by the society, and the church, too, and he never meddled with other men’s sins, as it is called. He said he knew very well that slavery was in many respects wrong, but it was a something that the church was not accountable for.’
‘Brother Crossburn is a lovely brother,’ said Mr. Bexly. ‘and the great Head of the church has called him into a wider field of usefulness, while we<illegible> but mourn his loss.’
‘If I understand Mr. Sterns,’ said Shiltey, ‘he wishes to know what course I would be likely to pursue on the subject of American slavery, should I become the pastor of the church.’
‘Exactly,’ said Sterns, ‘that hits the nail on the head.’
‘In the first place, Mr. Sterns, it might he well to inform you what course I would be likely to pursue in reference to yourself, for you tell me yon are not a Christian.’
‘I never told you that I was not a Christian. I hope I know what religion is. I met with a change at the time of the great revival, before I was twelve years of age. I have always felt sure that I got religion about that time, although I hare never felt it my duty to unite with the church.’
‘You think yon got religion when twelve years of age. Perhaps Mr. Sterns will tell us what makes him think so.’
‘I suppose I know how I felt; I was old enough to know what my feelings were.’
‘No doubt,’ said Mr. Shiltey. ‘I should, however. be very glad to learn how you felt; it is always pleasing to hear the mesas by which men are brought from darkness to light, and from the power ox Satan unto God.’
‘I have no objection to tell you,’ said Sterns; ‘I hope I am not ashamed of religion when it stands by itself, but when mixed up with everything, I don’t believe in it. When I was converted, it was down at the stone school-house, while elder Perkins was preaching. I was sitting by a window, and looking out upon a little grove of maple trees. All at once, the leaves of the maples looked as bright as silvery, and every leaf seemed to be praising God for his goodness. Well. I thought this very strange; and while I was endeavoring to make out what it meant, a most beautiful young woman, with wings, and a rainbow round about her head, stood before the window. She looked right in my face, and called my name three times, pointing with her finger up to the sky. I don’t know how long she stood, but by-and-by she raised slowly up, up, until she appeared no larger than a little shining speck, and then disappeared altogether I felt then-I felt-I don’t know hew I did feel-but told Elder Perkins all about it, and he felt sure that I had met with a change. I did not sleep much that night, you may be sure; I was filled wish love for every thing, and every body.’
‘Did you love your neighbor as your self,’ said. Shiltey.
‘I loved everybody, and Christian people looked good to me, and I loved to hear them talk.
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
The United States Constitution is ‘a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell.’
‘The free States are the guardians and essential supports of slavery. We are the jailers and constables of the institution. There is some excuse for communities, when under a generous impulse, they espouse the cause of the oppressed in other States, and by force restore their rights; but they are without excuse in aiding other States in binding on men on unrighteous yoke. On this subject, OUR FATHERS, IN FRAMINO THE CONSTITUTION, SWERVED FROM THE RIGHT. We their children, at the end of half a century, see the path of duty more clearly than they, and must walk in it. To this point the public mind has long been tending, and the time has come for looking at it fully, dispassionately, and with manly and Christian resolution. No blessing of the Union can be a compensation for taking part in the enslaving of our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to be perpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that it can only continue through our participation in wrong doing. To this conviction the free states are tending.’-WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING.

ï¿½The young woman that you saw looking through the window resembled an angel, did the not?ï¿½ said the Elder.
ï¿½Exactly like an angel, for all the earth,ï¿½ said Sterns, ï¿½just as like as two peas; she had wings.ï¿½
ï¿½I think it must have been a seraphim,ï¿½ said Mr. Shilsey, ï¿½or a cherubim; or, it might have been one of Zechariahï¿½s women, who had wings like a stork, and carried the Ephah to the land of Shinah; or, it might haw been the woman spoken of in Revelation, to were given two wings of a great eagle, that she aright fly into the wilderness. I have never heard of angels having wings.ï¿½
ï¿½Why!ï¿½ and Mr. Sterns.
ï¿½Why!ï¿½ said brother Bixly.
ï¿½Whyï¿½why!ï¿½ said the Deacon, ï¿½donï¿½t angels fly?ï¿½
ï¿½Yes,ï¿½ said Shiltey, ï¿½and so do cannon balls, and so do fugitives from the house of bondage; but they are not provided with wings, and I am sorry for it.ï¿½
ï¿½Do you say that deacon, with a most comical face, ï¿½do you say that angels hainï¿½t got no wings?ï¿½
ï¿½Not that I am aware of,ï¿½ said the minister; ï¿½and if the fact of Mr. Sternsï¿½s conversion rests upon his having seen an angel with wings, I must be permitted to doubt. I think the man is deceived, as are thousands who see great eights, hoar glorious sounds, and feel an indescribable feeling. If a man hath not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his." "If a man says he loves God. and yet hates his brother, he is a liar, and the truth is not in him." I exhort Mr. Sterns, and all like him, to repentance, to speedy repentance; for the wrath of God is related from heaven against all the workers of iniquity." I admonish you, air, a judgment is near to come, when the sinner hall be "turned into bell, with all the nations that forget God," and obey not the Lord Jesus Christ. Purify your heart, through a belief of truth, and bring firth fruit in accordance with an enlightened faith and understanding of what God has revealed and requires. Such is the course I should pursue with my friend Sterns, and all others, who, like him, may have area angels with wings, or without wings, or heard the leaves of the maple trees praising God.
ï¿½Donï¿½t you believe,ï¿½ said the deacon, ï¿½that men often see sights, and hear sounds when they are converted? What do you make of Paul?ï¿½
ï¿½If Mr. Sterns has been following the footsteps of Paul, I shall not object so much to his miraculous conversion; but, so far from this, he has not even made a public confession of faith in winged angels. The tree is known by its fruits. I must doubt the miracle.ï¿½
ï¿½I donï¿½t care what you doubt,ï¿½ said Sterns. ï¿½I donï¿½t say any thing against you; but as good men as you are donï¿½t doubt it. Elder Crossburn has known greater things take place at conversions than what happened to me. I donï¿½t care what a man may think of my self, nor how he puts it on to myself; but, as I am acting for others, I want to know your real views on slavery.ï¿½
 ï¿½Well,ï¿½ said Mr. Shiltey, ï¿½to-morrow, the Lord willing, I will give you a specimen of my preaching, from which you will be able to gather somewhat of my views. I shall endeavor to use great plainness of speech.ï¿½

From the New York Tribune, March 19.
THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH.
 If the people of this country, North and South, could simply be brought to consider fairly and understand fully the nature and influences of Human Slavery, and the views and purposes of the Republicans with reference thereto, the great struggle of our age would be ended forthwith, and the next Presidential Election carried by the Republicans by the votes of the Slavs as well as the Free States. We were beaten in 1856 mainly because, in about half of the country, our side of the question to be decided was not allowed to be presented or argued, and the people of the Fifteen States were kept wholly, and those of the remaining States partially, in darkness with regard to our objects, while the moat infamous misrepresentations of those objects Were freely circulated on every side. There was no section, no corner of the North, in which the champions of Slave Democracy were not at perfect liberty to present and inforce their views, without the smallest danger of interruption, much less personal injury; while throughout the Slave States, our speakers were allowed no hearing, our journals were destroyed in the post-offices, or their circulation obstructed by terrorism, and even our ballots were not allowed to be distributed at the polls. The Press of that vast region systematically misrepresented and reviled us; so that, while journals were, without impediment or objection, established in the North expressly to champion Slavery and its Extension, the enemies of Slavery were not, and are not yet, allowed a hearing at the South. To change all this is the evident duty of the hour.
One of the most deplorable consequences of the state of things we have briefly depicted is a perpetual iteration by the Pro-Slavery oracles, and a general but most unfounded conviction throughout the Slave States, that the Republicans are hostile to the South, and that their National Triumph will work injury if not ruin to that section. In vain do we disclaim any enmity or ill will towards the Southï¿½in vain do we repeat that we sock her renovation, not her ruinï¿½in vain do we demonstrate that the triumph of Republicanism, even, to the extent of the utter overthrow and disappearance of Slavery, would largely and rapidly increase the industry, wealth, population and power of the South, while increasing also the energy, security and happiness of her people. The South does not hear usï¿½her ears are shut against usï¿½while tying spirits, in the shape of Satanic journals, are sent among her people to perpetuate and aggravate their mistaken views of our acts and motives, and their consequent estrangement from us.
Under these circumstances, a number of Free-State men have resolved to appeal to their fellow-citizens for the means of inaugurating the canvas of 1860 by printing and circulating gratuitouslyï¿½for the moat part among the citizens of the border Free and Slave Statesï¿½a very large cheap edition of Mr. H. R. Helperï¿½s Impending Crisis of the South,ï¿½ a work which, as the production of one born and reared to maturity in a central Slave State, defies the cavil that those who make the most outcry against Slavery know next to nothing of it, save by hearsay. Mr. Helper is a North Carolinian, still a young man, who was led by the spirit of adventure to California, where he learned to contrast Free Labor with that of Slaves, and to weigh one against the another. His conclusions an embodied in the work now under consideration, which seemï¿½in part because of its Southern originï¿½better calculated for general circulation than any other yet issued. No man can candidly peruse it, and not be convinced that Slavery is an enormous blu nde as well as cruel wrong, and that its abolition is the indispensable basic of Southern advancement and, prosperity.
Mr. Helperï¿½s book has been hailed with enthusiastic approval by the Anti-Slavery. Press of all schools, and commended by many wise men as the best Republican text book. It has been extensively circulated and read; but its price ($1) is such as to forbid its universal currency. It is now proposed to reprint it more compactly and cheaply, so that One Hundred Thousand Copies of it may be afforded for $16,000, or sixteen cents per copy, and thus give it the widest possible gratuitous circulation, especially in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Indiana, Delaware, Maryland, and the other border Slave States. It is confidently believed that such circulation will be a signal and seasonable preparation for a Republican triumph in 1860, and for a speedy extinction of Slavery, at least throughout the present border Slave States. In support of this fort, the following appeals are addressed to Republicans universally:
New York, March 9. 1859.
Dear Sir: If you have read and critically examined the work, yon will probably agree with us, that no course of argument so successfully controverting the practice of Slavery in the United States, and enforcing a precise and adequate view of its prostrating effects, material and moral, has equaled that of the volume entitled "The Impending Crisis of the South: How to Meet it," by Hinton Rowan Helper of North Carolina.
 No other volume now before the public, as we conceive, is, in all respects, as well calculated to induce, in the minds of its readers, a decided and persistent
<c02>
repugnance to Slavery, and a willingness to co-operate in the effort to restrain the shameless advances and hurtful influences of that pernicious institution. 
The extensive circulation of a copious compend of the work in question, among the intelligent, liberty-loving voters of the country, irrespective of party at locality, would, we believe, be productive of most beneficial results; and to thin end we trust on will assist us in carrying oat a plan we have devised, for the gratuitous distribution of One Hundred Thousand copies of such a compendï¿½which, if contracted for and published, will contain about two hundred pages, and be bound in pamphlet form. 
ï¿½One hundred thousand copies of the contemplated compend, which, on about two hundred pages, would contain very nearly all the matter now embraced in the regular volume (which sells for one dollar per copy) can be had, well printed on good paper, for sixteen cents eachï¿½$16,000 in the aggregate. This amount we propose to raise in such sums as you and other good friends of a good cause feel disposed to subscribe. 
ï¿½In all cases, when convenient, contributors to the cause will please make their subscriptions in the form of drafts, or certificates of deposit, payable to the order of the Hon. Wm. H. Anthon, No. 16 Exchange place, New York City, our Treasurer and Disburser, who will regularly, through the columns of the Tribune, acknowledge receipts of the same.
ï¿½Every person who subscribes Ten Dollars or more, will, if timely application be made, be entitled to as many copies of the compend for distribution as he may desire, not exceeding the number that the amount of his subscription would pay for at net cost.
ï¿½Subscribersï¿½ names, with the sums severally subscribed by them, in all cases where the amount is Ten Dollars or more, will appear, alphabetically arranged, in the latter part of the compend.
ï¿½Correspondence or personal interviews in relation to this enterprise, may be had with any one of the undersigned, who will be pleased to receive subscriptions in aid of its speedy consummation. 
ï¿½An early response from you is respectfully solicited.ï¿½ WM. H. ANTHON.

ï¿½Mr. Helper is a native of North Carolina, who, as the result of careful observation and extensive inquiry, has reached the very obvious and just conclusion that Human Slavery is the great primary curse of the South, impeding its progress in morals, intelligence, industry and wealth. This conclusion, with the facts on which it is founded, is embodied in his book entitled "The Impending Crisis of the South"ï¿½a work everywhere received and hailed, by the advocates of Free Labor, as one of the most impregnable demonstrations of the justice of their cause, and the vital importance of its triumph to our National and general well-being. Were every citizen in possession of the fuels embodied in this book, we feel confident that Slavery would soon peacefully pass away, while a Republican triumph in 1860 would be morally certain.
ï¿½It is believed that this testimony of a Southern man, born and reared under the influence of Slavery, will be more generally listened to and profoundly heeded, whether in the Slave or in the Free Stales, than an equally able and conclusive work written by a Northern man. And it U very desirable, therefore, that a cheap compend of its contents, fitted for gratuitous circulation, be now made and generally diffused in those Statesï¿½Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Indiana and Illinoisï¿½which are to decide the next Presidential contest.

The whole matter is that submitted to the judgment, and commended to the liberality of all who believe Freedom preferable to Slavery. It will be seen that <illegible> more than one hundred persons have thus far subscribed about one-fifth of the sum required to print and circulate gratuitously One Hundred Thousand copies of Mr. Helperï¿½s work, 
<c03>
and that considerably the largest subscription yet made is that of a Southern clergyman. If the residue is made upï¿½as we fervently trust it may beï¿½ the larger portion of it will probably be contributed in sums of $1 to $10, though larger amounts will of course be most welcome. If the active Republicans of any township or county would join in contributing a sum of $20 to $100, they can receive the whole amount of their subscriptions in copies of the work at cost priceï¿½two hundred copies for $32, three hundred for $48, and so on. We believe those copies, widely distributed, would be worth to them tar more than their cost. At all events, we urge those who stand for Free Labor, Free Soil and Free Men, to consider the matter forthwith, and do what their judgments and hearts shall prompt. We hope when we next speak of the enterprise, to announce that the whole sum required has been made up.
MASSACHUSETTS LEGISLATURE.
Debate on the Proposed Law against the Rendition
of Fugitive Blares.
[We give a pretty full report of the debate in the House of Representatives last Monday and Tuesday evenings. The report is compiled from the Bee, Advertiser and Journal, with some additions. The debate was spirited; but it was instructive to perceive how generally the enemies of a Personal Liberty Law had absented themselves from the discussion, doubtless deeming it, as one of the Boston members called it, ï¿½fancy legislation.ï¿½ These traitors to freedom and humanity, whether present or absent, should not be forgotten by the people.]
MONDAY EVENING, March 29.
The special assignmentï¿½the bill to secure freedom to all persons within this Commonwealth.
Mr. RAY of Nantucket made a few brief remarks in support of the bill.
Mr. RICE of Worcester was in favor of the substitute offered by Mr. Griffin of Malden, which went only to the extent of forbidding the unconstitutional rendition of fugitive slaves, He offered an amendment to the title of the billï¿½so that it should read, ï¿½a bill to prevent the unconstitutional rendition of fugitive slaves.ï¿½
Mr. CUSHING of Newburyport made a few remarks expressing his regret that a fifteen minute rule had been adopted, as he had something to say in regard to it. At the early part of the session he bad pressed the matter on the House, but it bad been allowed to lie unnoticed till the present time. He had nothing to say at the present time on the merits of the bill. He desired to hear first some affirmative reasons from the Committee on Federal Relations for the passage of the bill. He would move, however, that when the vote be taken, it be by yeas and nays.
The motion was unanimously agreed to.
Mr. RICE of Worcester moved that the fifteen minute rule be suspended, and that members be allowed to speak thirty minutes.
Mr. JOHNSON of Abington opposed the motion, and the House refused to alter the time.
Mr. BORDEN of Fall River, chairman of the Committee on Federal Relations, advocated the bill. - He believed it was right and just; that it was demanded by the people of the Suite, and the time had arrived for us to declare that every man standing on the soil of the Commonwealth shall he a free man. He preferred the original bill to the substitute.
Mr. BORDEN moved to make the penalty ï¿½ten yearsï¿½ imprisonment,ï¿½ instead of five, as proposed. Mr. B. had not concluded when his fifteen minutes had expired.
Mr. WELLS of Greenfield moved that the gentleman be allowed to proceed and finish his remarks. Mr. MORRIS of Boston moved to extend the time of each speaker fifteen minutes.
Mr. BENT of Chelsea moved to amend by allowing each member thirty minutes till the subject was disposed of.
Mr. CUSHING of Newburyport rose to a point of order; he thought the motions were out of orderï¿½ that die motion to extend to thirty minutes had already been pronounced upon. Mr. ELDRIDGE of Canton hoped that the time would be extended. He did not believe that any man could give all his reasons for voting pro or con in fifteen minutes. He wanted to hear the gentleman from Newburyport on the subject, not only upon the constitutional questions involved, but on some of those conversions of his in the past to constitutional principles.
Mr. CUSHING replied, and maid that he had not changed his views on this question. He did not propose to enter upon any personal question; he did not believe that any good would result from an explanation of all the public or private acts and opinions of his, during forty years; he did not think it would aid the House in understanding the merits of the question. The constitutional questions connected with the subject could be slated in fifteen minutes, but they could not be argued in a much longer time.
The Chair decided that the motion to extend the time was in order.
Mr. WILLIAMS of Shrewsbury hoped the time would be extended.
Mr. GIFFORD of Provincetown hoped that the rules would not be suspended.
Mr. TUCKER of Boston opposed the motion to suspend. He did not oï¿½re to suspend. He did not care to hear any speeches on the subject. The question was whether this House would or would not trample the Constitution of the United States. That was the whole question, and his mind was already made up not to do any such thing.
Other gentlemen followed, in favor and against, but the House refused to extend the time.
The amendment offered by Mr. BORDEN was not agreed to.
The question then recurred on the substitute offered by Mr. GRIFFIN of Maiden.
Mr. CUSHING of Newburyport moved to amend the substitute by striking out the second section, and inserting ï¿½nothing in the act contained shall be deemed to apply to a case of extradition of a fugitive from service under the Constitution and acts of Congress of the United States.ï¿½
Mr. CUSHING said that the amendment be had proposed went behind the bill offered by the committee, and came close to the Constitution of the United States. The bill and the substitute practically reached the same endï¿½the bill openly annulling the Constitution and the substitute acts of Congress which grow out of the Constitution; therefore they were both alike objectionable.
MR. CUSHING proceeded to argue the constitutional questions involved, and referred particularly to the case lately decided in the Wisconsin case, and stating the course of that decision; that the united voice of the Supreme Court bad sustained that decision concurred in by Judge McLean, whose opinions and sympathies upon these subjects were well known.
 Mr. WELLS of Greenfield, said he was much obliged to the gentleman from Newburyport for the statement be had made in regard to the Wisconsin decision. He did not doubt that the decision of the Supreme Court, in the case, was a model one, as it had been called by the gentleman; its decisions were apt to be of that class; but its precise effect upon the State of Wisconsin was yet to be seen. Wisconsin was free, and unless be had mistaken the temper of the people of that State, she would always be free from the action of the fugitive slave law.
Mr. W. in conclusion moved to amend the amendment offered by Mr. C. by striking out the words, ï¿½and acts of Congress of the United States.ï¿½
Mr. CUSHING replied. He said that the Wisconsin case was not an action of the United States against Wisconsin, but an action between individuals, brought in the courts of the United States. What was to be done, he could not say; but to him it was apparent that Wisconsin, since that decision, had been taking the back trackï¿½returning to her fealty to the Constitution.
Mr. RICE of Worcester, was glad the gentleman had cited the Wisconsin ease; it was just to the point. Mr. R. proceeded and gave a narrative of the matter. He said that the Supreme Court of the United Sates was only a political engine of great power, and when its decisions conflicted with State rights and individual natural rights, it was time for the people of the States to preserve their rights.
He asked the Clerk to read from the statutes of 1855, and claimed that that declaration was the sentiment of the people of the State, and the bill now before the House was only potting into legal form that declaration. He advocated the substitute.
Mr. LOTHROP of Boston, contended that the Wisconsin decision had no bearing on the question before the Home. That decision might be constitutional; that was not the point at issue. The fugitive slave act was repugnant to the moral sense of the Northern community. He proceeded to denounce the law, bet though it was so repugnant, though he owed his election to a seat in the House 
<c04>
to votes of colored citizens, he could not support the bill because he believed that it nullified the Constitution of the United States. He wanted to present, as a State, a clean record in 1860.
Mr. ELDRIDGE of Canton moved that the vote on the question be taken on Wednesday at 4 oï¿½clock, and that it be further discussed to-morrow evening.
Mr. GEORGE of Groveland addressed the House, advocating the bill. He said it had been said on the floor of the House that these petitioners were foolishï¿½not knowing what they asked for, or else knowing, desirous to have the State do unconstitutional acts; but the petitioners embraced intelligent menï¿½clergymen, citizens in the highest walks of life.
Mr. STEARNS of Chicopee opposed the bill. He thought if the General Government was as vile as was claimed by the advocates of the bill, it would be far more consistent to go out of the government than to stay in it.
The further consideration was then postponed to to-morrow evening at 7 1-4 oï¿½clock.
Adjourned at quarter to 10.
TUESDAY EVENING, MARCH 30.
The House re-assembled at 7 1-4.
On motion of Mr. CLARK of Winchester, the special assignment was takenï¿½the bill in relation to fugitive slaves.
Mr. BORDEN of Fall River, moved that the vote be taken at 3 oï¿½clock to-morrow afternoon, and that the general debate close this evening. Agreed to.
Mr. CUSHING of Newburyport, modified the amendment offered by him yesterday, to strike out the second section of the Committeeï¿½s bill, and insert: ï¿½Nothing in this act contained shall be deemed to apply to a case of extradition of a fugitive from service under the Constitution of the United States and acts of Congress duly enacted in pursuance thereof.ï¿½
Mr. WELLS of Greenfield moved to strike out the last clause, commencing ï¿½and acts.ï¿½ Agreed to, 89 to 15.
The amendment of Mr. Cushing was rejected.
The question recurred on the substitute offered by Mr. GRIFFIN of Maiden.
Mr. GRIFFIN moved to perfect his bill by adding the words ï¿½as a slaveï¿½ after the words ï¿½owing service or labor,ï¿½ in the first section. Agreed to.
Mr. HINCKLEY of Barnstable, said he was in favor of the substitute. He defended the petitioners against the charge of the gentleman from Newburyport, that they are ï¿½evil disposed persons.ï¿½ He believed that Massachusetts is on the side of freedom to-day, as she was many years ago, when the gentleman from Newburyport said she had nailed her flag to the mast on this question. Mr. H. read an extract from a speech delivered by Mr. Cushing on the question of the public lands, in which the position of Massachusetts on questions of constitutional liberty was eloquently stated. The reading of this extract was received with applause. Mr. H. proceeded to speak of the position of Massachusetts in the days of the Revolution. He then read some further extracts, among which was one eulogistic of Nathan Dane and the ordinance of 1787. Does the gentleman from Newburyport (asked Mr. H.) take the back track, and repudiate this doctrine now? Returning to the immediate question, Mr. H. expressed himself in favor of Mr. Griffinï¿½s bill. Congress has no authority whatever to pass any fugitive slave law. Before he had finished his remarks, his time had expired.
Mr. DREW of Kingston made an appeal to the House to vote for the bill. He held that it was his duty to vote for this bill, in order that he might not violate his oath to support the constitution of Massachusetts which runs parallel with this law.
Mr. WILLIAMS of Shrewsbury advocated the substitute, and gave his reasons for so doing. The end sought, he said, was to secure liberty to every man in the State, that there never might be another slave on the soil of Massachusetts. The difficulty was our connection with the Federal governmentï¿½three prominent difficulties. The first objection was that it was treasonable. Mr. W. replied to these objections by stating what was treason in the sight of the Constitution, showing that it had no foundation. The second objection was that it nullifies the law. This was answered by the fundamental principles on which all law was founded. On this point Mr. W. quoted from Blackstone, in regard to natural rights. The third objection was that it was a nullification of the Constitution.
He read from the Constitution, and asked when the people of this State resigned the right of trial by jury. He had tried to read the decision of Chief Justice Taney on the Dred Scott Decision, but his heart revolted at it, it was so repugnant to his feelings. In all cases where the question was between unrighteous law on the one point and the consciences of men on the other, the path of duty was plainï¿½ conscience, duty to God was beyond all human enactments.
Mr. JOHNSON of Abington, said that he had not formed his views of slavery from books, from novels and newspapers, but from personal observation in the South, in city and country, and he unhesitatingly pronounced it the meanest, the worst curse that God had ever suffered to scourge mankind. He said he was not sorry that a lengthy discussion had taken place on this bill. It was proper that 16,000 petitioners should be respectfully treated, though they formed but a small fraction of the population. He should yield to no man in his feelings of detestation for the system of slavery. It was a robber in our national politics, ever acting upon the aggressive. A bill for the punishment of atheism has been before this Legislature. If anything, said Mr. J., could justify atheism, if ever I could for a moment be induced to doubt the existence of God, it would be because such an unmitigated curse as slavery is suffered to continue in the world. He had always voted with the political party which took the strongest ground for freedom; the liberty party, the free soil party, the republican party. He went on to announce the principles of the republican party on the shivery question. This party differed from the Garrisonian party in their estimate of the constitution and of the value of the Union. It was attached to both, and proposed to do its work under the constitution. He found no fault with the abolitionists, and would not speak a disparaging word of the Anti-Slavery Society. That Society is right, said Mr. Johnson; it is right in its principles, all right; and we cannot gainsay those principles, or the arguments by which they support their position. But with their extreme views they cannot obtain an ascendancy in the government Now what is the best course to pursue? We have already on the statute book the Personal Liberty Law of 1855, which secures every thing we need or want. To pass this law would perhaps be a triumph of abstract principle, but nothing more. The present law is very effectual, and will serve for the protection of every slave who may hereafter come here. Having thus an effectual law, and a public sentiment to back it up, is it politic to pass this bill? Let us look at it practically. Here Mr. Johnsonï¿½s time expired.
Mr. BORDEN of New Bedford, said he did not believe the passage of this act could harm the republican party. He believed the republican party would go forward, and take higher ground than it had yet taken. Mr. B. went on to comment upon the fears that have been expressed that we shall do something unconstitutional. Is there a man here who will refuse to help a fugitive slave on his way to freedom? Not one. Yet if we do aid a slave, we violate the law, which the gentleman from Newburyport says has been declared constitutional. We violate the law in our hearts every day, and should violate it individually every day, if an opportunity should occur. Yet we fear to put our individual opinions into the shape of law. The law of 1855 is as much a violation of the constitution as this is. Those who passed it, and who uphold it, know that it is practical nullification of law. Now it is best to say what we mean, and stand by it. Mr. B. said he did not believe that the clause in the Constitution had any reference to the fugitive slaves. He argued this point until his time expired.
Mr. CUSHING of Newburyport said it was not his purpose to speak this evening, unless the debate diverged from general into personal topics. But the gentleman from Barnstable had imposed a necessity upon him to speak. He had nothing to retract of what he had said 20 years ago. He would say it again if it was pertinent to the occasion. Every man is placed in contradictory positions under different circumstances, and be trusted that if there was ever occasion to defend Massachusetts, the ability to defend her would be vouchsafed to him, as he was sure the will would be. Does it follow that because Massachusetts loves liberty, she is for this hill? The question is whether we will fulfill a <illegible> compact. The Union of the States is not only the tower of our strength as regards foreign nations, but the charter of our own liberties. Massachusetts has done, in the act of 1855, everything she can do. Why pass this? Is there any purpose to indulge an hysterical passion for doing something, we know
<c05>
not what? What has been the sentiment of Massachusetts on this question? The first example of a compact of extradition is to be found in our early history. In 1643, the colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut and New Haven, formed a compact, the fundamental principle of which was an extradition law for fugitive slaves. [Mr. C. proceeded to read the law he alluded to.] This was the very beginning of extradition laws this country. Passing over the intermediate history, one of the first fruits of the revolution was the ordinance of 1787. Nathan Dane was the author of the extradition clause attached to that ordinance, a clause which, when we eulogize that ordinance, we remember to forget.
Mr. CUSHINGï¿½S time having expired, Mr. GIFFORD of Provincetown moved that He be allowed to proceed.
Mr. C. moved to strike out the second section, and proceeded, on that motion, with his speech. He related how this extradition clause passed into the Constitution of the United States, and became a monument of the good faith of the United States. The same law was incorporated into the Missouri compromise act. No portion of the United States was dedicated to freedom, but with the reservation of the extradition of fugitive slaves.
 The speaker knew the earnest convictions of the people of Massachusetts, and believed they did wrong in the pursuit of an abstract right. He knew that a man who squarely met this question incurred disfranchisement in Massachusetts. He would meet the result, for be spoke from conscientious convictions as well as others.
He would not trouble the House to express his attachment to the Union. But he would say that its dissolution would transfer from Europe to this country the dire spectacle of threatening and impending war.
He alluded to the authors of this measure, who were open and avowed disunionists, and who had introduced this measure, not for the purpose of helping the Republican party, but for distracting it and destroying it. He closed by saying that be knew it was unwise for him to speak; it would be better to leave those of the Republican party who knew how unwise the measure is, to deal with it. But he could not avoid doing his duty.
Mr. GRIFFIN of Malden, said it seemed to him that the gentleman from Newburyport had wandered more widely from the real question than anybody who had spoken before him. He next alluded to the remarks of Mr. JOHNSON, and said that if the mission of the Republican party was to creep into the custom-houses and post-offices by avoiding this question, it had better die at once. (Applause.) The words of freedom were upon that gentlemanï¿½s lips, but the whole tenor of his speech was that it is policy to postpone this question. That is the cry of the tempter. He for one preferred the manly way in which the Democratic party met the question.
 Passing from this point, Mr. G. said it was not because Mr. Garrison, or Mr. Phillip, or anybody else was in favor of the bill, that he should vote for his substitute; he did not know as they were in favor of it. Nor should he be deterred by any fear of consequences to the Republican party. He believed that the Constitutional clause relating to fugitive slaves, does refer to fugitive slaves, but that Congress has no right to legislate on the subject.
Mr. G. proceeded to read the following propositions upon which he stood in this controversy:
1. Each member of the Legislature is bound by his oath to interpret the fugitive slave laws according to his understanding of the Constitution. The decisions of courts concerning it are merely testimony bearing upon its constitutionality, deserving more or lea consideration according to the characters of the tribunals from which the decisions come.
II. Congress has no power to legislate respecting the rendition of fugitives from labor, inasmuch as that power has been reserved to the several States, and not conceded to the confederation. Consequently any law enacted by Congress on that subject must be void, binding upon no one.
III. The laws of 1793 and 1850 arc unconstitutional and void for these additional reasons:ï¿½
1. Trial by jury is not preserved, though it is the right of both claimant and slave.
2. Petty officials are by it clothed with judicial functions in defiance of constitutional provisions.
3. Evidence is admitted and made conclusive in defiance of the ï¿½law of the land.ï¿½
IV. The proposed legislation will throw an efficient protection around the slave, and place the man-stealer beyond the succor of the federal courts.
Mr. G. quoted from the writings and speeches of Jefferson, Webster, and others in support of his proposition.
Mr. G. next alluded to the recorded opinions of the best of our members of Congress, Charles Sumner, Horace Mann, Mr. Rantoul, Gen. Wilson, Mr. Adams, all of whom held the same opinion. Mr. Gï¿½s concluding point was that the law of 1850 was unconstitutional in its details. The legislature of this very year is committed to an act in violation of the Constitution as much as this act. We have passed, on the recommendation of the Governor, a bill relating to fugitives from justice, in direct conflict with the act of 1793. The gentleman from Newburyport consented to its passage.
Mr. CUSHING The gentleman is mistaken. I voted against it.
Mr. GRIFFIN. At any rate we had no such warm defence of the Constitution as we have had to-night. It had been admitted, observed the speaker, by the gentleman from Newburyport. that the constitutionality of the fugitive slave law was a debatable matter at the commencement of this session. If this was so, then he (Mr. Griffin) did not interpret his oath to be subject to a subsequent decision of Judge Taney. What were General Wilson, Charles Sumner, and Charles Francis Adams in Congress for but to advocate those sentiments which we propose to enact into a statute in this Commonwealth? If we have the right to legislate concerning fugitives from justice, we nave the same right concerning fugitives from labor. He said that Charles Sumner had always maintained the unconstitutionality of the fugitive slave law; for that he had been stricken down; and now, if the Legislature did not embody the sentiments of the people, it would be skulking the question, leaving their Representatives in Congress without support on the positions they had taken. The argument of Mr. G. was able and convincing.
Mr. WELLS of Greenfield, next spoke, chiefly in reply to the speech of Mr. Cushing, in respect to constitutional questions which had been raised and discussed. He then spoke of the picture of civil war raised by the gentleman from Newburyport, and said that when Franklin Pierce took the presidential chair, the country was peacefulï¿½that the measures of his administration precipitated the only danger of civil war which this country had ever seenï¿½the dangers which at one time existed in Kansas, and which were brought into existence by the violation of that compact which the gentleman now asks as to observe. It will not do for gentlemen fresh from those deeds to talk to us about disunion. Talk of civil war! said the speaker, the only danger of that kind which has been imminent existed upon the plains of Kansas, and the administration of Franklin Pierce was responsible for the horrors there enacted. (Applause.)
Mr. WELLS thought that, in spite of either of the proposed laws, the United States government, if it set about it, could carry back slaves, and he had some desire to make legislation constitutional if possible. He would rather act treason than enact it. The sentiments of Massachusetts, as a whole, undoubtedly is that no slave shall be carried out of her borders; but this sentiment can never be safe from violation until we get a Supreme Court that is up to the sentiment of Massachusetts. Mr. Wells offered the following as a substitute for the bill before the House, believing that it would accomplish the desired object in a constitutional method:ï¿½
Any person arrested in, or brought into this Commonwealth under pretence that he is held to service or labor in say other State, shall forthwith be carried before some Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, and thereupon before said Justice the issues between said person and the claimant shall be made up and the ease shall be heard and determined in the same manner and the same proceedings had as is now provided by the ï¿½ chapter of the acts of 1855 for the trial of issues under habeas corpusï¿½and all the provisions of said act shall apply so far as applicable to all cases arising under this act.
Any person who shall remove from this Commonwealth any person under pretence that such person owes service or labor in some other State; and any person who shall in any way, directly or indirectly, aid or abet or assist in such removal, and any person attempting such removal or assisting in such attempt. except in accordance with the provisions of this act, and in pursuance of a judgment in accordance therewith, shall be punished by imprisonment in the State Prison not more than ten years.
<c06>
Mr. TUCKER of Boston made a brief speech in opposition to the bills before the House.
Mr. BORDEN of New gave notice of certain amendments. Adjourned.
The vote on the Bill was taken on Wednesday afternoon last, with the following result: On the amendment proposed by Mr. Wells of Greenfield, Yeas, 84, Nays, 132; and it was rejected. On the amendment moved by Mr. Griffin, of Malden (published by us last week) Yeas 124, Nays 90; and it was voted so to amend the Bill On ordering the Bill, as thus amended, to a third reading, the vote stood Yeas 106, Nays 109, and the Bill was declared REJECTED BY THE HOUSE. We shall publish the Yeas and Nays, in full, next week. Just previous to taking the final vote Mr. Wells, of Greenfield, asked to be excused from voting, saying that a negative vote would place him in seeming opposition to a cause to which he ï¿½had devoted his life.ï¿½ While he could not vote in the affirmative, as he believed the Bill, as amended, fraught with the greatest evils to the freedom. The House refuted to ex, ** ** and Mr. Wells, with several others from when a different action was looked for, voted to defeat the Bill.
The Liberator.
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
BOSTON, APRIL 1, 1859.
CLERICAL CALUMNY.
Jane Taylorï¿½whose works were held in high esteem by pious people half a century ago, as being well suited to stir up their pure minds by war of remembrance of the things they were most apt to forget and neglectï¿½wrote a small book called ï¿½Profession not ï¿½Principle.ï¿½ It passed through many editions, received much commendation, and may still be found on the upper shelves of the libraries of elderly people of a serious turn, but in little read at the present day. Since it contains nothing against slavery, and is a work of sedative rather than exciting character, we suggest to the American Tract Society to publish a new edition of it for the special benefit of the clergy, who seem to be preeminently under the dominion of the error which it opposes. Judging by the language of these Reverend gentlemen, ever since philanthropy has been doing those works of Christian reform which the church left undone, they have held ï¿½professionï¿½ to be the most essential element, the sine qua non of ï¿½principle."
The latest instance of the verbal expression of this ideaï¿½it is constantly expressed in the actions of the clergyï¿½we find in an account, given by the Worcester correspondent of the Altas and Bee, of an address delivered in the Union church, Worcester, on the evening of the 17th inst., by Rev. Henry T. Cheever of Jewett city. Connecticut, in explanation of the ideas of the new ï¿½Church Anti-Slavery Society of the United States,ï¿½ which he had just helped to manufacture. Among the reasons given by this gentleman for the formation of such a society, was the follow:
2. There never has been any distinct Christian or church Anti-slavery society. The American Anti-Slavery Society did a great pioneer work, and its originators were men of whom the country might well be proud, but it never was distinctly Christian, and latterly it had come to be mainly guided by men-truly and thoroughly anti-slavery inclined, and so far having our fullest sympathy, but notoriously and avowedly rejectors and opponents of the fundamentals of Christianity. In view of this fact, the "Church Anti-Slavery Society" meets a long-felt wantï¿½.
The ï¿½long-felt wantï¿½ here spoken of has been borne by the Reverend gentleman and his associates with exemplary fortitude. They have so effectually kept their desires in subjection as to have retrained, for many years, from all outward and visible manifestation of them. The last faint approach towards such a manifestation was seen in this city in May 1857, when it was announced in the Transcript (and also by a written notice posted in the vestibule of the hail where the New England Anti-Slavery Convention were holding their Twenty-seventh Annual Meeting) that a ï¿½Christian Anti-Slavery Meetingï¿½ would be held in Boston, and held (of all places in the world) in Park Street church.
At this meetingï¿½in which the church-members of Boston showed themselves ready to come together for the examination of slavery to the full capacity of the house, when the clergy called themï¿½there was abundance of strong denunciation of slavery, without even the attempt to incite the crowded and attentive <?> ence to organize or act for its immediate abolition, or even the attempt to follow up the impression there made by the appointment of appointment of subsequent meetings. The strongest speech on the occasion was made by Rev. George B. Cheever; the only suggestion made for action against slavery, in any part of the meeting, was made in this speech; and this was a declaration that the voting that all children of slaves should be bors free after forty years would be ï¿½THE SIMPLEST REMEDY OF THE WHOLE INIQUITY THAT COULD BE CONCRIVED OF.ï¿½ The selection of a mode of emancipation so very gradual as this for unqualified eulogyï¿½the declaration, by a minister least tainted with compromise of all the holders of the Christian Anti-Slavery meeting, that he would be perfectly satisfied to leave the existing four millions of slaves in bondage through their whole livesï¿½is significant and noteworthy: but the question to which we wish now to direct the attention of our readers isï¿½what were the points of diversity, between the Anti-Slavery meetings then simultaneously going on in the Melodeon and in Park Street Church, which caused the holders of the latter to designate it, by way of contrastï¿½the ï¿½Christian Anti-Slavery Meeting.ï¿½
The actual points of diversity between the New-England Anti Slavery Convention and the Park St, meeting were theseï¿½
1. The former was one link in a chain of operations which has lasted twenty-seven years, and is to last until slavery is abolished, devoting two days every year to the work of discussing principles and measures, and raising funds, to incite the people of the United States to earnest and persistent warfare against slavery.
The latter was a single afternoon meeting, making no arrangement, and expressing no desire, for any further action upon its subject.
2. The former was free to all speakers, seeking the aid of all those who wished to oppose slavery.
The latter was not free at all, and permitted nobody to speak except clergymen, who had preciously been selected and invited by other clergymen.
3. The former vindicated, enlarged and strengthened its established system of operations for the diffusion of these ideas and purpose: SLAVEHOLDING IS A SIN AGAINST GOD.ï¿½NO COMPROMISE WITH SLAVERY!ï¿½NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS!
The latter warmed its hearer, with fervid declamation, and them left their awakened interest to cool and evaporate, without area the attempt to direct it <illegible> action.
4. The former called itself, as usual, an ï¿½Anti-Slavery Convention.ï¿½
The latter christened and advertised itself a ï¿½Christian Anti- Slavery meeting.ï¿½
Now, since the points just mentioned are the only points of difference between these two meetings, it must be some or all of these upon which is founded the claim of the latter to be considered (in itself, and also by contrast with the former) a Christian meeting. But, in every one of these points, that is to say, in systematic persistency, in freedom, in thoroughness, in practical efficiency, and in appellation, as it seems to us, the Park Street meeting was less satisfactory and less Christian than the other. Yes, even in appellation. For the advertised title of the Park Street meeting would necessarily repel all who do not choose to adopt, or who do not think themselves authorized to adopt, the name of Christian, distinguishing both

these classes as uninvited. Whereas the New England Convention, inviting all to unite with it in acting against slavery, may gain the cooperation of Jews and infidels as well as of Christians, and, as far as it does gain these, will certainly unite them in a good work, the abolition of slavery, and also in an Christian work, opposition to a wide-spread and increasing sin against God. In view of these considerations, and of the limitations and deficiencies of the Park St. meeting is regard to Anti-Slavery character, its advertised either ‘ Christian’ seems to have all the hollowness, as well as all the formal pretentiousness, of the Jewish phylactery.
This judgment is corroborated by the fact that no either meeting formally claimed by advertisement as ‘ Christian Anti-Slavery’ has been held from May 1857 all the advent of the society recently formed at Worcester.
A meeting with this name was indeed advertised to he held in Boston on Wednesday afternoon of ‘ anniversary week,’ 1858; but, before that time came, it was countermanded, for a specified reason, and since then, nothing has been heard of it. The indifference which did not care to appoint another ‘ Christian Anti-Slavery meeting’ in the whole year 1858 is only a fair parallel to the reason given for not holding the advertised one, which was, substantially, that those clergymen who had been selected by their clerical brethren as safest to represent, at the proposed meeting, what they called ‘ Christian Anti-Slavery,’ had preferred to speak at the anniversary of a pro-slavery organization-the American Tract Society! which was to be held on the same evening.
In the light give by these antecedent movements of Rev Dr. George B. Cheever and his associates in Boston, let us look at the Position of the new organization formed by that gentleman and his associates at Worcester, as expressed, (in the quotation above) by Dr. Henry T. Cheever in that city, in the first meeting held under the auspices of the ‘ Church Anti-Slavery Society of the United States.’ 
This Reverend gentleman says-’ There never has been any distinct Christian or Church Anti-Slavery Society.’ And again-the American Anti-Slavery Society * * * never was distinctly Christian.’ And again-The American Anti-Slavery Society had latterly come to be mainly guided by men * * * notoriously and avowedly rejecters and opponents of the fundamentals of Christianity.’ 
Passing by the inevitable professional assumption of Rev. Henry T. Cheever, that the adjectives ‘Christian’ and ‘church’ are absolutely so identical in meaning that each of them necessarily implies the other-we remark that it is unfortunate for the’ Church Anti-Slavery Society of the United States’ that the chosen representative of its ideas and policy begins his work, in its very first meeting, by misrepresentation and falsehood.
In view of the constitutional basis, the entire history, and the entire official action of the American Anti-Slavery-Society, it is utterly absurd, as well as grossly false, to pay that it has ever been other than’ distinctly Christian.’ 
Neither can the Rev. Henry T. Cheever be allowed, unquestioned, to smuggle into this case the theological peculiarities of himself and his little sect, assuming that they are to be counted among the’ fundamentals of Christianity.’ 
If Christianity is to be analyzed, to be defined by a summary of its constituent parts, we stand upon the summary made (and presented, as such, to his disciples) by its first great teacher, Jesus of Nazareth, in these words:’ Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength; this is the first commandment. And the second is like, namely, this; Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.’ We decline to accept the assumption that any’ fundamental’ articles remain to be added to this statement; and if the statement needs any commentary, we prefer to take that of Jesus himself, who plainly taught that love to God was to be manifested by good works to the neighbor, and that the neighbor was any man who needed help that we could give.
We therefore call upon the Rev. Henry T. Cheever to produce his evidence of these three things:
Where has the American Anti-Slavery Society, in its official action, ever violated either of these fundamentals of Christianity?
Where has it ever failed to act in accordance with them?
Where have its leaders and guides ever avowedly rejected and opposed them?
Until this representative of the’ Church Anti-Slavery Society’ shall prove, or retract, these charges, we brand him as a false witness and willful calumniator. -C. K. W.
THE NEW TEMPERANCE MELODIST: consisting of Glees, Songs, and Pieces, composed and arranged for the use of the various Temperance Organizations in the United States and Canada. By Stephen Hubbard, Author of’ Wesleyan Sacred Harp,’ ‘ Musical Gems,’ &c. This is an excellent collection, well adapted to promote the noble cause it has in view, just published by John P. Jewett & Co., Boston. The form of it is neat and convenient, and the typography legible and fair.
MEETINGS ON FAST DAY-On account of the illness of Mr. Garrison,(who has been confined to the house the past week, and, though improving, finds himself unable to speak in public at present,)it will be necessary to make some changes in the speakers announced to attend the County Meetings in Plymouth and Worcester Counties on Fast Day. Mr. PILLSBURY may be relied upon, we believe, to be at Leominster, and Mr. HEYWOOD at Abington. We hope that C. C. BUPLEIGH will be able to be at Leominster, in which case WENDELL PHILLIPS will attend the meeting at Abington; but of these latter arrangements we cannot now speak with certainty. -S. M.
SENOR CASSERES. By advertisement it will be perceived that the Pionist Casseres has postponed his Concert to Monday evening, April 4th, at Mercantile Hall. This is done to oblige Mr. Carl Zerrahm, whose benefit takes place on Saturday evening. Senor C. is specially deserving of the most liberal support of all who appreciate rare artistic merit and genuine worth; and we hope to see the hall crowded on Monday evening. Gov. Banks, Hon. Edward Everett, Hon. G. S. Hilard, Hon, Rufus Choate, Charles Hale, Esq., Rev. James Freeman Clarke, Wendell Phillips, Esq., &c., are among his patrons.
For the past fortnight, the Editor of the Liberator has been too unwell to attend to his editorial duties. There are many things demanding his critical notice; especially the disgraceful action of the Massachusetts Legislature upon the question of slave-hunting in this Commonwealth-action which will excite surprise, disgust and indignation in every part of the State; for it is in utter disregard of the voice of THE PEOPLE. But a day of reckoning is to come!
EXCITEMENT AT HOLLY SPRINGS. We are informed that a merchant of Boston obtained a requisition from the Governor of Massachusetts on the Governor of Mississippi, for the body of a merchant at Holly Springs, who was charged with obtaining goods under false pretences from the Boston merchant. The proper writ was granted by the Governor of Mississippi to an agent of the Boston merchant. Armed with this writ, the agent proceeded to Holly Springs last week, and made the arrest.
On his arrival there, his business was soon found out, a public meeting called, and resolutions adopted to the effect that Massachusetts having always resisted the rendition of slaves, had no right of any sort of’ requisition’ upon the people of Mississippi, and that the agent of the Boston house be notified to leave, or he would be’ trotted through.’ Of course, he left burnt all his’ requisition’ papers, and promised never to return-Traveller, 29 inst.

REMARKS OF WILLIAM C. NELLL,
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON FEDERAK RERATIONM
In support of the Memorial of Colored Citizens of Massachusetts, protesting against the Dred Scott Decision,
Thursday, February 10, 1859.
MR. CHAIRMAN, AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE: We fed happy in being permitted to speak for ourselves, touching those things wherein we are outraged by the Dred Scott Decision.
That Decision was brought to the consideration of the General Court at its last session; the action of which body, however, though acceptable as far as it went, was suggestive, and not remedial; for which, among other reasons, your memorialists this year renew their appeal.
We believe that Decision, by which; the United States Supreme Court declares that we are not, and cannot become citizens of the United States, is in palpable violation of the 1st section of Article 4th of the Constitution of the United Suites, which expressly declares-’ The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.’ Believing that you, gentlemen,-as also a very large majority of the Legislature,-accept this clause of the Constitution in its legitimate interpretation, it is not necessary to array many of the numerous and undisputed authorities,-gathered both from the history of our country and the precedents of its governmental officials,-as proofs that colored Americans are citizens of the United. States.
This matter, though in another form,(relating to colored citizens obtaining passports when travelling in foreign countries,)was before the General Court in 1857, and the Committee on Foreign Relations then submitted an able report,(Senate Document, No. 172,)prolific in facts of colored American citizenship. I will, however, cite two opinions, and these from eminent Massachusetts men, delivered in the Senate of the United States, December, 1820.
And, first, from Hon. Harrison Gray Otis, who argued that protection and allegiance involved citizenship.’ If,’ said Mr. Otis,’ he(the colored man) possesses these rights, and stands in this relation to the State, he is a citizen. In Massachusetts, many persons of color stand in this relation to the State, and he should believe, until the contrary was shown, that the same was true in every State in the Union.’ 
Second. Hon. William Eustis said-’ In Massachusetts, free people of color constituted and were in fact an elementary part of the Federal compact. They were as directly represented as the whites in the initiatory process, and from their votes in common with those of the whites emanated the Convention of Massachusetts by whom the Federal Constitution was received and ratified.’ 
Is not this proof that colored persons are citizens of the United States?
It was so thought by Rev. Hosea Easton, a colored son of Massachusetts, whose sentiments, uttered several years since, are to-day accepted by all with whom he is identified in the Old Bay State, and throughout the Union. He said-
‘ The colored people who are born in this country are Americans in every sense of the word-Americans by birth, genius, habits, language, &c. They are dependent on American climate, American aliment, American government, and American manners, to sustain their American bodies and minds. The withholding the enjoyment of any American privilege from an American man, either governmental, ecclesiastical, civil, social, or alimental, is in effect taking away his means of subsistence; and, consequently, taking away his life. Every ecclesiastical body which denies an American the privilege of participating in its benefits becomes his murderer. Every State which denies an American a citizenship, with all its benefits, denies him his life. The claims the colored people set up, therefore, are the claims of Americans. Their claims are founded in an original agreement of the contracting parties, and there is nothing to show that color is a consideration in the agreement.
It is well known that when the country belonged to Great Britain, the colored people were slaves; but when America revolted from Britain, they were held no longer by any legal power. There was no efficient law in the land, except martial Jaw, and that regarded no one as a slave. The inhabitants were governed by no other law, and except by resolutions adopted from time to time, by meetings convoked in the different colonies.
Upon the face of the warrants by which these district and town meetings were called, there is not a word said about the color of the attendants.
In convening the Continental Congress of the 4th of September, 1774, there was not a word said about color. At a subsequent meeting, Congress met to get in readiness twelve thousand men, to act in any emergency. At the same time, a request was forwarded to Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, to increase this army to twenty thousand men. Now, it is well known that hundreds of the men of which this army was composed were colored men, and recognized by Congress as Americans.’ 
But, happily for us, we have the potent voice of another distinguished Massachusetts man, confirmatory of our position. I allude to Justice Curtis, who, in dissenting from Chief Justice Taney, laid down the following impregnable doctrine:-
‘ First-That the free native born citizens of each State are citizens of the United States. Second- That as free colored persons born within some of the States are citizens of those States, such persons are also citizens of the United States. Third-That every such citizen, residing in any State, has a right to sue and be sued in the federal courts as a citizen of that State in which he resides.’ 
This question has been comprehensively and unanswerably stated by George D. Wells, Esx., in his manly, earnest and eloquent presentation of our Memorial to the Legislature. He says:-
‘ It does seem to me, that if a man is a citizen of a school-district, he is a citizen of the town in which that school-district is situated; if he is a citizen of a town, he is a citizen of the county which embraces that town within its limits. If he is a citizen of a county, he is a citizen of the State which includes that county; if he is a citizen of a State, he is a citizen of that confederation of States which includes that State, and which governs it with a common government. And, therefore, it is impossible for me to determine how a man can be a citizen of a State, and not a citizen of the United States; how the faith and allegiance which a man owes to his State can be otherwise than due to the United States government, which includes and overshadows the State government under which he lives. That is the way the matter strikes me; and I cannot see it in any other light.’ 
And allow me, in behalf of the Memorialists, to say, that is the way in which the matter strikes us, and we cannot see it in any other light.
But this righteous doctrine has been rejected by the Supreme Court, and your memorialists are left without protection or redress as citizens of the United. States; and until that decision be reversed, or an entire change be wrought in the structure of the Supreme Court,(of which there is no hope,)or Massachusetts be divorced from the Union, they must stand deprived of those privileges and immunities which are guaranteed to them by the Constitution of their country.
Your memorialists also beg leave to remind the General Court, that, by the laws of the Southern States, they are still prohibited, under the severest penalties, from visiting any of those States, for any purpose, however laudable, on any pretence whatever; that a considerable number of the colored citizens of Massachusetts have already been seized in Southern ports, while engaged in lawful undertakings, thrust into prison, and sold into interminable slavery; that the attempt of Massachusetts legally to test the validity of the laws under which these hapless victims were thus seized and enslaved, was instantly and brutally repulsed by; South Carolina and Louisiana, followed by the enactment of laws, on their part, making it a penitentiary offence for any commissioner of Massachusetts, or of any other State, to endeavor to seek legal redress in such cases.
I stand before you to-day the victim of the violated rights of United States citizenship. I was born on. Beacon Hill, within a stone’ s throw of the spot
<c03>
where I now stand; freeborn-my mother being of Massachusetts stock, and unable to trace my genealogy back to slavery. Yet, because my father’ s birth-place happened to be in a Southern city, I am prohibited this day from visiting near and dear relatives, unless at the risk of fines and jail imprisonment. I ask, why should not my rights be held as sacred under the Palmetto banner as those of any other son of the Old Bay State, white though he may be?
At a meeting of the Bar of the county of Suffolk, in 1850, on motion of Hon. Charles Sumner, my associate Mr. Morris was admitted to practice as a Counsellor and Attorney of the Circuit and District Courts of the United States; in accordance with which, Mr. Morris presented himself before Justice Sprague of the United States District Court, who, it is presumed, had ample evidence of his color, and was duly admitted to practice in the courts of the United States; and yet, gentlemen of the Committee, though thus officially recognized as a citizen of the United States, Mr. Morris, like myself and others who wear an unconstitutional complexion, are ostracised from visiting, as other citizens, the capital of our common country, or the States in one half of the Union. For these outrages, we ask redress at the hands of the Legislature of Massachusetts.
In many other departments of the government have precedents been established in favor of United States citizenship of colored Americans.
The act of May, 1820, makes it criminal for a citizen to engage in the slave trade. Can people of color do it? And yet penal laws arc construed strictly.
Colored men have obtained passports, copyrights, letters patent, etc., together with other official recognition of their citizenship.
Impressed colored seamen have been claimed by the National Government as citizens of the United States; and kidnapped colored citizens have been restored to home and freedom by action of the Executive of their respective States.
Indeed, the admission of Missouri into the Union,(in 1820,)hinged upon the question of colored citizenship, a clause in the compact being, virtually, that’ No citizens of the United States shall be excluded from the enjoyment of any of the privileges and immunities to which such citizens are entitled under the Constitution of the United States’ And it was not until this position was taken, that President Monroe declared the admission of Missouri into the Union to be complete.
But American pro-slavery and color-phobia care nothing for precedent or right; substituting caprice for the one, and might for the other.
Gentlemen, the colored citizens of Massachusetts have little to complain of, so far as her statutes are concerned. Here we stand equal before the law, except as to the military clause. And though the names of colored freeholders are not put into the jury box, we believe both of these omissions to be in violation of our constitutional rights.
In the struggles between our own, our native land, and its enemies, colored Americans have shared the labors and braved the dangers equally with white Americans as citizens of Massachusetts and as citizens of the United States. The first blow in the American Revolution was struck by a colored person-Crisps Attucks-who full the first martyr on the fifth of March, 1770, thus ushering in the day which history has selected as the dawn of the American Revolution. At Lexington, also, and especially at Bunker Hill, where Peter Salem, a colored man, turned the tide of battle by shooting Major Pitcairn. Colored soldiers were participants on the various battle-fields from these to Yorktown, besides signal service at New Orleans, and naval exploits on the lakes in the war of 1812, which war was undertaken because of the impressments of three seamen, two of whom were colored,-satisfactory proof at least that they were American citizens,-services which, when performed by white Americans, have been universally acknowledged as passports to perennial fame, while for us Chief Justice Taney, of the United States Supreme Court, rules that we colored men hate no rights that white men are bound to respect.
In front of the venerated Hancock Mansion, at the close of the Revolutionary War, John Hancock, in person, presented a colored volunteer company of soldiers an appropriate Banner, bearing his initials, as a tribute to their courage and devotion throughout the struggle.
General Washington then, as also General Jackson since, awarded colored soldiers many tributes for their gallant and patriotic services in’ the times that tried men’ s souls.’ And Chief Justice Story, in alluding to the subject, regretted that he had not compiled a volume of facts in relation to the bravery of colored soldiers; facts which can be piled Olympus high in proof that the colored American has ever proved loyal, and ready to die, if need be, at Freedom’ s shrine. The amor patria has always burned vividly on the altar of his heart. He loves his native land its hills, and valleys green.
Gentlemen of the Committee, we are here to-day to protest against this inequality. In the touching eloquence, as well as Spartan brevity, of a well-known colored clergyman, Rev. Peter Williams-’ We are natives of this country; we ask only to be treated as well as foreigners. Not a few of our fathers suffered and bled to purchase its independence. We ask only to be treated as well as those who have fought against it. We have toiled to cultivate it, and to raise it to its present prosperous condition. We ask only to share equal privileges with those who come from distant lands to enjoy the fruits of our labor.’ 
From early childhood I have loved to visit the Eastern wing of this State House, and read from the four stones taken from the Monument which once towered from Beacon Hill summit, these lines:-’ Americans, while from this eminence scenes of luxuriant fertility, of flourishing commerce, and the abodes of social happiness, meet your view, forget not those who, by their exertions, have secured to you these blessings.’ 
In the spirit with which these words are revered by the white inhabitants of Massachusetts, so do we, the colored citizens of this State, ask you, gentlemen, and through you, the Legislature, to remember that we, too, have at least done our part to secure to our beloved Commonwealth these blessings.
Feeling assured, gentlemen of the committee, that you are ready to do all in your power to shape the legislation of Massachusetts for the more perfect security of her colored citizens, our appeal is submitted to you in full confidence that it will not be made in vain.
AN UNDER-ESTIMATE.
To the Editor of the Liberator:
I observe that the Rev. James Freeman Clarke, in his article on the Condition of the Free Colored People, states the property of that portion of this people residing in Philadelphia, at $800,000. In the statistical account prepared and published by the late Dr. Parish, President of the old Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery, that property was set down at $1,350,000 more than twenty years ago. It may be safely put at $2,000,000 now, without including Churches, estimated at the time above mentioned to be worth $114,000 more.
I am much pleased with the article in question, and thank you for transferring it to your columns.

Extract of a Letter from a devoted anti-slavery woman in Rhode Island:-
"I am rejoiced at the reception Sarah Remond is meeting in England, and the good she is doing there. She well deserves the former, and the latter she is admirably fitted for. How cheering it must be to her after all she has suffered here! How much cause we have to hang our heads in shame for our country!"

SOUTHERN GALLANTRY AND HOSPITALITY.-The New York Commercial Advertiser gives us an account of the brutal and disgraceful manner in which a lady of Brooklyn has lately been driven from Aiken, S. C. She had been spending the winter at a hotel there, with a sick daughter, who required a mild climate.- Some weeks ago, she wrote a letter to a brother in western New York, in which she spoke of the evils of slavery. This letter was published, and some one sent a copy of the paper to the postmaster at Aiken. A public meeting was immediately called, and a committee appointed to ferret out the writer. A Northern gentleman who, as an invalid, happened also to be at the hotel, was suspected, and was threatened with lynch law if he did not confess. As, of course, he could only persist in a denial, he would probably have suffered accordingly, had not the lady nobly come forward to exonerate him by acknowledging the letter as her own, affirming at the same time that she was not privy to its publication.
The citizens then turned their wrath upon her, and she was peremptorily ordered to leave the place in forty-eight hours. The lady pleaded for more time on behalf of her sick daughter, but the citizens of Aiken knew no such humanity. She asked for liberty to remain until her husband could arrive to escort her and her sick child. But the citizens of Aiken knew nothing of gallantry or courtesy. The order was imperative, in spite of the earnest pleading of the woman, wife and mother. Nor was this all. The landlord of the hotel ordered the mother and sick daughter to "leave his premises in half an hour." What further occurred between the lady and the inhuman citizens of Aiken, South Carolina, we are not informed. But we learn that on Wednesday morning last, her husband received a letter apprising him of her situation, and on the afternoon of the same day he started for the South, and met his wife and daughter at Columbia, on their way home.
THE CAPTURE OF AFRICANS IN TELFAIR.-Their Subsequent Discharge. The following extract from a letter received yesterday, by the editor, from a highly respectable citizen of Telfair county, will be found to contain full particulars of the recent arrest of Africans in Worth county, and the circumstances under which they were discharged from custody by the United States Deputy Marshal:
‘ John F. McRae, of this county, Deputy U. S. Marshal, having been instructed by the Marshal to capture any Africans he might find passing through the county, was informed that there were thirty-six in charge of one or two men, on their way to the Alabama line. He Summoned a posse of ten men, some of our best citizens, pursued and overtook the negroes in Worth county, arrested them as U. S. Marshal, under his instructions, and brought them to Jacksonville and put them in jail, and sent an express to the Marshal, at Savannah, reporting the arrest, and his action in the matter. The negroes remained here until the answer from the Marshal came, which stated that he had telegraphed and written to the authorities at Washington, and had received no answer respecting the Africans then known to be in the country; that the Government knew of the Africans being in the State, and had given him no orders, and that his advice was to turn them loose, and let them proceed on their way. When this letter came, and as the arrest had been made by the authority of the United States, and in good faith, the negroes were released; the persons in charge of them paying for the provisions they consumed, and medical attention to those that were sick. One or two of those assisting in the arrest retook the negroes, and demanded payment for their outlay and trouble, threatening to carry the Africans to Gov. Brown if it was not paid. A compromise was made to the satisfaction of the parties, and"the last of the Wanderer’ s cargo" were allowed to depart in peace. The negroes disliked very much to leave, as they had been treated very kindly by the citizens.- Savannah Republican, 22d inst.
TESTIMONIAL TO GIDDINGS.-The colored people of New-York and Brooklyn last evening, at the Shiloh Presbyterian Church, corner of Prince and Marion streets presented to the Hon. Joshua It. Giddings, a fine American gold watch, as a testimonial of their confidence and gratitude. A large Bible was also presented to him in behalf of the ladies of the Giddings and Jeliffe Association. The church was crowded, principally by colored people, and the proceedings were constantly interrupted by applause. The Rev. Dr. Cheever opened the meeting with prayer, the Rev. Mr. Garnet made the presentation, and Mr. Giddings responded, telling some stories of fugitive slaves in Ohio, which excited the audience intensely. He said that war had been declared by the Supreme Court on the blacks, and black men must meet it.- He did not counsel war, hut he would say, as he had said in the House of Representatives to slaveholders and doughfaces, that if he were a slave and God gave him the power, he would gain his liberty if he had to travel from Mississippi to Maiden upon the dead bodies of slaveholders. He counseled resistance to any and all attempts to enslave. In Ohio, he said, they had elected a Supreme Court which would support and protect the liberty of her citizens at the expense of any conflict with the officers of the United States.-N. Y.

THE MUSTEE.
487pp. Price, $1.25.
WE beg leave, through this circular, to call your attention to a new work recently issued by us, and one that we are confident will occupy a high position among the many works that have been published within the lost half century.
In point of interest and delineation of character we say, without fear of contradiction, that it is not equalled by anything that has emanated from the press for years.
Editors, clergymen, and literary men generally have vied with each other in bestowing upon it laudatory comments superior to those received by any work since the publication of’ Uncle Tom’ s Cabin.’ 
The writer shows a command of language unequalled by novel writers of the age; while, at the same time, the intense interest which accompanies each and every page in the book is unsurpassed by any work of fiction. We annex a few extracts from the many hundreds of notices we have received in its favor, and will leave the public to decide for themselves, after having read the opinions of others:-
From Rev. T. Starr King.
‘ My recollections of the interest of the story(the Mustee,)the nobleness of its purpose and sentiment, and the careful preparation and labor which the style and structure of the work evince, and which I owe to a perusal of the manuscript some months ago, are still fresh; and it is from the impulse of these that I heartily thank you for the copy you have sent me; and I commend the book, so far as my words can avail, to the community.’ 
From Wendell Phillips, Esq.
‘ I have read the Mustee with an interest which deepens as the story advances. Mr. Presbury has made skilful use of his materials. His plot is excellent, and his characters cannot fail to awaken the heartiest sympathy.’ 
From R. Shelton McKenzie, Esq.
‘ Very well written, with an interesting plot, and well distinguished characters. We hope to meet the author again.’ 
From the Taunton Gazette.
‘ An extremely interesting tale, told with a good degree of art, and no waste of paper.’ 
From the New Hampshire Patriot.
‘ Equal in highly wrought interest and dramatic effect to anything we recollect in the range of modern fiction. Can be read only with’ bated breath,’ eager curiosity, and thrilling emotion.’ 
From the Boston News.
‘ Written with great care, and possesses uncommon interest and value.’ 
From the Salem Observer.
‘ As a work of fiction as well as one of superior moral aims, it possesses great value.’ 
From the Hartford Courant.
Powerfully written. The characters well drawn, and the incidents well told.’ 
From the New Hampshire Palladium
‘ A fascinating work, and does honor to the head and heart of its author. Its style is one of great force and purity.’ 
From the Boston Post.
‘ The story is naturally told, and we heartily commend it to our readers and the public.’ 
From the Providence Post.
‘ An excellent story.’ 
From the Boston Recorder.
‘ Above the ordinary class of novels, and adjusted to the taste of numerous readers.’ 
From the Providence Tribune.
‘ The Mustee is a book that will go through the family before it goes to the library, and, when read, will not be forgotten. It will bear reading a second time.’ 
From the Schenectady Star.
‘ The author wields a vigorous pen, and the story cannot fail to interest.’ 
From the Christian Freeman.
‘ One of the best books of the season.’ 
From the Bangor Jeffersonian.
‘ A story of absorbing interest.’ 
From the Charlestown Advertiser.
‘ A novel of uncommon ability,-readable and entertaining in an uncommon degree.’ 
From the Cambridge Chronicle.
‘ The characters all well drawn.’ 
From the Bangor Whig and Courier.
‘ Attractive even to the mere lovers of something exciting.’ 
From the Congregationalist.
‘ Well wrought up, and of a high degree of merit.’ 
From the Daily Advertiser.
‘ The plot exhibits decided artistic skin,-the language manly and chaste, its sentiments sound, and its style bold and vigorous.’ 
From the Home Journal.
‘ Very excellent.’

Ayer’ s Sarsaparilla,
A compound remedy, in which we have labored to produce the most effectual alterative that can be made. It is a concentrated extract of Fan Sarsaparilla, so combined with other substances of still greater alterative power at to afford an effective antidote for the diseases Sarsaparilla is reputed to cure. It is believed that such a remedy is wanted by those who suffer from Strumous complaints, and that one which will accomplish their cure must prove of immense service to this large class of our afflicted fellow-citizens. How completely this compound will do it has been proven by experiment on many of the wont cases to be found of the following complaints:-

SCROFULA AND SCROFULOUS COMPLAINTS, ERUFTIONS AND ERUPTIVE DISEASES, ULCERS, PIMPLES, BLOTCHES, TUMORS, SALT, RHEUM, SCALD HEAD, SYPHILIS AND SYPHILITIC AFFECTIONS, MERCURIAL DISEASE, DROPSY, NEUMALGIA OR TIC DOULOUREUX, DEBILITY, DYSPEPSIA AND INDIGESTION, ERYSIPELAS, ROSE OR ST. ANTHONY’ S FIRE, and indeed the whole class of complaints arising from IMPURITY OF THE BLOOD.
This compound win be found a great promoter of health, when taken in the spring, to expel the foul humors which fester in the blood at that season of the year. By the timely expulsion of them many rankling disorders are nipped in the bud. Multitudes can, by the aid of this remedy, spare themselves from the endurance of foul eruptions and ulcerous sores, through which the system will strive to rid itself of corruptions, if not assisted to do this through the natural channels of the body by an alterative medicine. Cleanse out the vitiated blood whenever you find its impurities bursting through the skin in pimples, eruptions, or sores; cleanse it when you, find it is obstructed and sluggish in the veins; cleanse it whenever it is foul, and your feelings will tell you when. Even where no particular disorder is felt, people enjoy better health, and live longer, for cleansing the blood. Keep the blood healthy, and all is well; but with this pabulum of life disordered, there can be no lasting health. Sooner or later something must go wrong, and the great machinery of life is disordered or overthrown.
Sarsaparilla has, and deserves much, the reputation of accomplishing these ends. But the world has been egregiously deceived by preparations of it, partly because the drug alone has not all the virtue that is claimed for it, but more because many preparations, pretending to be concentrated extracts of it, contain but little of the virtue of Sarsaparilla, or any thing else.
During late years the public have been misled by large bottles, pretending to give a quart of Extract of Sarsaparilla for one dollar. Most of these have been frauds upon the sick, for they not only contain little, if any, Sarsaparilla, but often no curative properties whatever. Hence, bitter and painful disappointment has followed the use of the various extracts of Sarsaparilla which flood the market, until the name itself is justly despised, and has become synonymous with imposition and cheat. Still we call this compound Sarsaparilla, and intend to supply such a remedy as shall rescue the name from the load of obloquy which rests upon it. And we think we have ground for believing it has virtues which are irresistible by the ordinary run of the diseases it is intended to cure. In order to secure their complete eradication from the system, the remedy should be judiciously taken according to directions on the bottle.

THE OXYGENATED BITTERS.
Nature, in her great laboratory, has stored some remedy adapted to every disease which’ flesh is heir to.’ But it requires the investigation and research of the philosopher to discover and apply this remedy. Such research and investigation have succeeded in discovering a remedy for that most afflictive dispensation, the 
DYSPEPSIA!
with all its lesser and numerous evils; and it may be safely asserted, that until the appearance of the Oxygenated Bitters, a case of Dyspepsia cured was a rare experience in medical practice. Now, under the influence of these Bitters, the rule is to curt, the rare exception, failure to cure.
Read the following, which the subscriber requests us to publish for the benefit of the afflicted:
An Obstinate and Inveterate Case of DYSPEPSIA, Cured by the Oxygenated Bitters.
The following, from a gentleman well known in the region in which he lives, ought to satisfy all those of little faith:
WATERTOWN, N. Y., July 28, 1858.
S. W. FOWLE & Co., Boston: SIRS-Nine years since, I was attacked by that curse of all diseases, Dyspepsia, which so affected me as to cause great oppression, fullness, and bloating of the bowels immediately after eating, accompanied with terrible pains in the stomach, often occasioning nausea, vomiting, acidity, and headache, together with general debility and suffering, altogether rendering life a burden.
After having tried every known remedy without effect, and despairing of ever regaining my lost health, I was induced to make use of the Oxygenated Bitten, the good effects of which were immediately visible on my health and system. Before using a whole bottle, I was entirely cured; and I feel a pleasure in inducing all like sufferers as myself to make use of this remarkable remedy.

THE PECULIAR INSTITUTION.
GREAT SLAVE AUCTION AT SAVANNAH.
Sale of Four Hundred and Twenty-Nine Men,
Women and Children.
From the New York Tribune of March 9.
The largest sale of human chattels that has been made in Star-Spangled America for several years took place on Wednesday and Thursday of last week, at the Race-Course, near the city of Savannah, Georgia. The lot consisted of four-hundred and thirty-six men, women, children and infants, being that half of the negro stock remaining on the old Major Butler plantations which fell to one of the two heirs to that estate. Major Butler, dying, left a property valued at more than a million of dollars, the major part of which was invested in rice and cotton plantations, and the <illegible> thereon, all of which immense fortune descended to two heirs, his sons, Mr. John A. Butler, sometime deceased, and Mr. Pierce M. Butler, still living, and resident in the City of Philadelphia, in the free State of Pennsylvania. Losses in the great crash of 1857-8, and other exigencies of business, have compelled the latter gentleman to realize on his Southern investments, that he may satisfy his pressing creditors. This necessity led to a partition of the negro stock on the Georgia plantations, between himself and the representative of the other heir, the widow of the late John A. Butler; and the negroes that were brought to the hammer last week were the property of Mr. Pierce M. Butler, of Philadelphia, and were in fact sold to pay Mr. Pierce M. Butler's debts. The creditors were represented by Gen. Cadwallader, while Mr. Butler was present in person, attended by his business agent, to attend to his own interests.
The sale had been advertised largely for many weeks, though the name of Mr. Butler was not mentioned; and as the negroes were known to be a choice lot and very desirable property, the attendance of buyers was large. The breaking up of an old family estate is so uncommon an occurrence that the affair was regarded with unusual interest throughout the South. For several days before the sale, every hotel in Savannah was crowded with negro speculators from North and South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, and Louisiana, who had been attracted hither by the prospects of making good bargains. Nothing was heard for days, in the bar-rooms and public-rooms, but talk of the great sale, criticisms of the business affairs of Mr. Butler, and speculations as to the probable prices the stock would bring. The office of Joseph Bryan, the negro broker, who had the management of the sale, was thronged every day by eager inquirers in search of information, and by some who were anxious to buy, but were uncertain as to whether their securities would prove acceptable. Little parties were made up from the various hotels every day to visit the Race Course, distant some three miles from the city, to look over the chattels, discuss their points, and make memoranda for guidance on the day of sale. The buyers were generally of a rough breed, slangy, profane and bearish, being for the most part from the back river and swamp plantations, where the elegancies of polite life are not, perhaps, developed to their fullest extent. In fact, the humanities are sadly neglected by the petty tyrants of the rice fields that border the great Dismal Swamp, their knowledge of the luxuries of our best society comprehending only revolvers and kindred delicacies.
Your correspondent was present at an early date; but as he easily anticipated the touching welcome that would, at such a time, be officiously extended to a representative of the Tribune, and being a modest man withal, and not desiring to be the recipient of a public demonstration from the enthusiastic Southern population, who, at times, overdo their hospitality and their guests, he did not placard his mission and claim his honors. Although he kept his business in the background, he made himself a prominent figure in the picture, and, wherever there was anything going on, there was he in the midst. At the sale might have been seen a busy individual, armed with pencil and catalogue, doing his little utmost to keep up all the appearance of a knowing buyer, pricing ‘likely nigger fellers,' talking confidentially to the smartest ebon maids, chucking the round-eyed youngsters under the chin, making an occasional bid for a large family, (a low bid-so low that somebody always instantly raised him twenty-five dollars, when the busy man would ignominiously retreat,) and otherwise conducting himself like a rich planter, with forty thousand dollars where he could put his finger on it. This gentleman was much condoled with by some sympathizing persons, when the particularly fine lot on which he had fixed his eye was sold, and lost to him forever, because he happened to be down stairs at lunch just at the interesting moment.
WHERE THE NEGROES CAME FROM.
The negroes came from two plantations, the one a rice plantation near Darien in the State of Georgia, not far from the great Okefonokee Swamp, and the other a cotton plantation on the extreme northern point of St. Simon's Island, a little bit of an island in the Atlantic, cut off from Georgia main land by a slender arm of the sea. Though the most of the stock had been accustomed only to rice and cotton planting, there were among them a number of very passable mechanics, who had been taught to do all the rougher sorts of mechanical work on the plantations. There were coopers, carpenters, shoemakers and blacksmiths, each one equal in his various craft to the ordinary requirements of a plantation; thus, the cooper could make rice-tierces, and possibly, on a pinch, rude tubs and buckets; the carpenter could do the rough carpentry about the negro quarters; the shoemaker could make shoes of the fashion required for the slaves, and the blacksmith was adequate to the manufacture of hoes and similar simple tools, and to such trifling repairs in the blacksmithing way as did not require too refined a skill. Though probably no one of all these would be called a superior, or even an average workman, among the masters of the craft, their knowledge of these various trades sold in some cases for nearly as much as the man-that is, a man without a trade, who would be valued at $900, would readily bring $1,600 or$1,700 if he was a passable blacksmith or cooper.
There were no light mulattoes in the whole lot of the Butler stock, and but very few that were even a shade removed from the original Congo blackness. They have been little defiled by the admixture o degenerate Anglo-Saxon blood, and, for the most part, could boast that they were of as pure a breed as the best blood of Spain-a point in their favor in the eyes of the buyer as well as physiologically, for too liberal an infusion of the blood of the dominant race brings a larger intelligence, a more vigorous brain, which, anon, grows restless under the yoke, and is prone to inquire into the definition of the word liberty, and the meaning of the starry flag which waves, as you may have heard, o'er the land of the free. The pure-blooded negroes are much more docile and manageable than mulattoes, though less quick of comprehension, which makes them preferred by drivers, who can stimulate stupidity much easier than they can control intelligence by the lash. 
None of the Butler slaves have ever been sold before, but have been on these two plantations since they were born. Here have they lived their humble lives, and loved their simple loves; here were they born, and here have many of them had children born unto them; here had their parents lived before them, and are now resting in quiet graves on the old plantation that these unhappy ones are to see no more forever; here they left not only the well-known scenes dear to them from very babyhood by a thousand fond memories, and homes as much loved by them, perhaps, as brighter homes by men of brighter faces; but all the clinging ties that bound them to living hearts were torn asunder, for but one half of each of these two happy little communities was sent to the shambles, to be scattered to the four winds, and the other half was left behind. And who can tell how closely intertwined are the affections of a little band of four hundred persons living isolated from all the world beside, from birth to middle age? Do they not naturally become one great family, each man a brother unto each?
It is true they were sold ‘in families;' but let us <illegible> a man and his wife were called a ‘family;' their parents and kindred were not taken into account; the man and wife might be sold to the pine woods of North Carolina, their brothers and sisters be scattered through the cotton fields of Alabama and the rice swamps of Louisiana, while the parents might be left on the old plantation to wear out their weary lives in heavy grief, and lay their heads in far-off graves over which their children might never weep. And no account could be taken of loves that were as yet unconsummated by marriage; and how many aching hearts have been divorced by this summary proceeding, no man can ever know. And the separation is as utter, and is infinitely more hopeless than that made by the Angel of Death; for then the
<c02>
loved ones are committed to the care of a merciful Deity; but in the other instance, to the tender mercies of a slave-driver. Those dark-skinned unfortunates are perfectly unlettered, and could not communicate by writing, even if they should know where to send their missives. And so to each other, and to the old familiar places of their youth, clung all their sympathies and affections, not less strong, perhaps, because they are so few The blades of grass on all the Butler estates are outnumbered by the tears that are poured out in agony at the wreck that has been wrought in happy homes, and the crushing grief that has been laid on loving hearts.
But, then, what business have ‘niggers' with tears? Besides, didn't Pierce Butler give them a silver dollar apiece? which will appear in the sequel. And, sad as it is. It was all necessary, because a gentleman was not able to live on the beggarly pittance of half a million, and so must needs enter into speculations which turned out adversely.
HOW THEY WERE TREATED IS SAVANNAH.
The negroes were brought to Savannah in small lots, as many at a time as could be conveniently taken care of, the last of them reaching the city the Friday before the sale. They were consigned to the care of Mr. J. Bryan, Auctioneer and Negro Broker, who was to feed and keep them in condition until disposed of. Immediately on their arrival, they were taken to the Race Course, and there quartered in the sheds erected for the accommodation of the horses and carriages of gentlemen attending the races. Into these sheds they were huddled pell mall, without any more attention to their comfort than was necessary to prevent their becoming ill and unsalable. Each ‘family' had one or more boxes or bundles, in which were stowed such scanty articles of their clothing as were not brought into immediate requisition, and their tin dishes and gourds for their food and drink.
It is, perhaps, a fit tribute to large-handed munificence to say that, when the negro man was sold, there was no extra charge for the negro man's clothes; they went with the man, and were not charged in the bill. Nor is this altogether a contemptible idea, for many of them had worldly wealth, in the shape of clothing and other valuables, to the extent of perhaps four or five dollars; and had all these been taken strictly into the account, the sum total of the sale would have been increased, possibly, a thousand dollars. In the North, we do not necessarily sell the harness with the horse; why, in the South, should the clothes go with the negro?
In these sheds were the chattels huddled together on the floor, there being no sign of bench or table. They ate and slept on the bare boards, their food being rice and beans, with occasionally a bit of bacon and corn bread, Their huge bundles were scattered over the floor, and thereon the slaves sat or reclined, when not restlessly moving about, or gathered into sorrowful groups, discussing the chances of their future fate. On the faces of all was an expression of heavy grief; some appeared to be resigned to the hard stroke of Fortune that had torn them from their homes, and were sadly trying to make the best of it; some sat brooding moodily over their sorrows, their chins resting on their hands, their eyes staring vacantly, and their bodies rocking to and fro, with a restless motion that was never stilled; few wept, the place was too public and the drivers too near, though some occasionally turned aside to give way to a few quiet tears. They were dressed in every possible variety of uncouth and fantastic garb, in every style and of every imaginable color; the texture of the garments was in all cases coarse, most of the men being clothed in the rough cloth that is made expressly for the slaves. The dresses, assumed by the negro minstrels, when they give imitations of plantation character, are by no means exaggerated; they are; instead, weak and unable to come up to the original. There was every variety of hat, with every imaginable slouch; and there was every cut and style of coat and pantaloons, made with every conceivable ingenuity of misfit, and tossed on with a general appearance of perfect looseness that is perfectly indescribable, except to say that a Southern negro always looks as if he could shake his clothes off without taking his hands out of his pockets. The women, true to the feminine instinct, had made, in almost every case, some attempt at finery. All wore gorgeous turbans, generally manufactured in an instant out of a gay-colored hand kerchief by a sudden and graceful twist of the fingers; though there was occasionally a more elaborate turban, a turban complex and mysterious, got up with care, and ornamented with a few beads or bright bits of ribbon. Their dresses were mostly coarse stuff, though there were some of gaudy calicoes; a few had earrings, and one possessed the treasure of a string of yellow and blue beads. The little children were always better and more carefully dressed than the older ones, the parental pride coming out in the shape of a yellow cap pointed like a mitre, or a jacket with a strip of red broadcloth round the bottom. The children were of all sizes, the youngest being fifteen days old. The babies were generally good-natured; though when one would set up a yell, the complaint soon attacked the others, and a full chorus would be the result. A young negro baby looks like an animated bit of india-rubber, and has wonderful powers of suction. They were very prevalent in the long show-room where the stock was all congregated the day of the sale, and those that were old enough to have positive powers of locomotion were perpetually crawling away from their mothers, and getting under the feet of visitors. They have a passion for climbing, and made strenuous exertions to scale the legs of people who didn't belong to them; if a man stood still for a minute, he was certain to have a baby hanging to each leg-like a crab. They didn't object to being knocked down, and rolled over, or being pitched across the room, or any trifle of that sort; but it seemed to disconcert them to step on their fingers.
The slaves remained at the race-course, some of them for more than a week, and all of them four days before the sale. They were brought in thus early, that buyers that desired to inspect them might enjoy that privilege, although none of them were sold at private sale. For these preliminary days their shed was constantly visited by speculators. The negroes were examined with as little consideration as if they had been brutes indeed; the buyers pulling their mouths open to see their teeth, pinching their limbs to find how muscular they were, walking them up and down to detect any signs of lameness, making them stoop and bend in different ways that they might be certain there was no concealed rupture or wound; and in addition to all this treatment, asking them scores of questions relative to their qualifications and accomplishments. All these humiliations were submitted to without a murmur, and in some instances with good-natured cheerfulness-where the slave liked the appearance of the proposed buyer, and fancied that he might prove a kind ‘mas'r.'
The following curiously sad scene is the type of a score of others that were there enacted:
'Elisha,' chattel No. 5 in the catalogue, had taken a fancy to a benevolent-looking middle-aged gentleman, who was inspecting the stock, and thus used his powers of persuasion to induce the benevolent man to purchase him, with his wife, boy and girl, Molly, Israel and Sevanda, chattels Nos. 6, 7, and 8. The earnestness with which the poor fellow pressed his suit, knowing, as he did, that perhaps the happiness of his whole life depended on his success, was touching, and the arguments he used most pathetic. He made no appeal to the feelings of the buyer; he rested no hope on his charity and kindness, but only strove to show how well worth his dollars were the bone and blood he was entreating him to buy. 
'Look at me, Mas'r; am prime rice planter; sho' you won't find a better man den me; no better on de whole plantation; not a bit old yet; do mo' work den ever; do carpenter work, too, little; better buy me, Mas'r, I'se be good sarvant, Mas'r. Molly, too, my wife, Sa, fus' rate rice hand; mosas good as me. Stan' out yer, Molly, and let the gen'lm'n see.'
Molly advances with her bands crossed on her bosom, and makes a quick short curtsy, and stands mute, looking appealingly in the benevolent man's face. But Elisha talks all the faster.
'Show mas'r yer arm, Molly-good arm dat, mas'r-she do a heap of work mo' with dat arm yet. Let good mas'r see yer teeth, Molly-see dat, mas'r,.teeth all regular, all good-she'm young gal yet. Come out yer, Israel, walk aroun' and let the gen'lm'n see how spry you be.'
Then, pointing to the three-year-old girl who stood with her chubby hand to her mouth, holding on to her mother's dress, and uncertain what to make of the strange scene.
'Little Vardy's only a chile yet; make prime gal by-and-by. Better buy us, mas'r, we'm fus' rate bargain'-and so on. But the benevolent gentleman found where be could drive a closer bargain, and so bought somebody else.
<c03>
Similar scenes were transacting all the while on every side-parents praising the strength and cleverness of their children, and showing off every muscle and sinew to the best advantage, not with the excusable pride of other parents, but to make them the more desirable in the eyes of the man-buyer; and on the other hand, children excusing and mitigating the age and inability of parents, that they might be more marketable and fall, if possible, into kind hands. Not unfrequently these representations, if borne out by the facts, secured a purchaser'. The women never spoke to the white men unless spokes to, and then made the conference as short as possible. And not one of them all, during the whole time they were thus exposed to the rude questions of vulgar men, spoke the first unwomanly or indelicate word, or conducted herself in any regard otherwise than as a modest woman should do. Their conversation and demeanor were quite as unexceptionable as they would have been had they been the highest ladies in the land, and through all the insults to which they were subjected, they conducted themselves with the most perfect decorum and self-respect. The sentiment of the subjoined characteristic dialogue was heard more than once repeated:
'Well, Colonel, I seen you looking sharp at shoe, maker Bill's Sally. Going to buy her?'
'Well, Major, I think not. Sally's a good, big, strapping gal, and can do a heap o'work: but it's five years since she had any children. She's done breeding, Ireckon.'
In the intervals of more active labor, the discussion of the reopening of the slave trade was commenced, and the opinion seemed to generally prevail that its re-establishment is a consumation devoutly to be wished, and one red-faced Major or General or Corporal clenched his remarks with the emphatic assertion that. We'll have all the niggers in Africa over here in three years-we won't leave enough for seed.'
THE SALE.
The Race Course at Savannah is situated about three miles from the city, in a pleasant spot, nearly surrounded by woods. As it rained violently during the two days of the sale, the place was only accessible by carriages, and the result was that few attended but actual buyers, who had come from long distances, and could not afford to lose the opportunity. If the affair had come off in Yankee land, there would have been a dozen omni busses running constantly between the city and the Race Course, and some speculator would have bagged a nice little sum of money by the operation. But nothing of the kind was thought of here, and the only gainers were the livery stables, the owners of which had sufficient Yankeeism to charge double and treble prices.
The conveniences for getting to the ground were so limited that there were not enough buyers to warrant the opening of the sale for an hour or two after the advertised time. They dropped in, however, a few at a time, and things began to look more en-encouragingly for the seller.
The negroes looked more uncomfortable than ever; the close confinement indoors for a number of days, and the drizzly, unpleasant weather, began to tell on their condition. They moved about more listlessly, and were fast losing the activity and springiness they had at first shown. This morning they were all gathered into the long room of the building erected as the ‘Grand Stand' of the Race Course, that they might be immediately under the eye of the buyers. The room was about a hundred feet long by twenty wide, and herein were crowded the poor creatures, with much of their baggage, awaiting their respective calls to step upon the block, and be sold to the highest bidder. This morning, Mr. Pierce Butler appeared among his people, speaking to each one, and being recognized with seeming pleasure by all. The men obsequiously pulled off their hats, and made that indescribable sliding hitch with the foot which passes with a negro for a bow; and the women each dropped the quick curtsy which they seldom vouchsafe to any other than their legitimate master and mistress. Occasionally, to a very old or favorite servant, Mr. Butler would extend his gloved hand, which mark of condescension was instantly hailed with grins of delight from all the sable witnesses.
The room in which the sale actually took place immediately joined the room of the negroes, and communicated with it by two large doors. The sale room was open to the air on one side, commanding a view of the entire Course. A small platform was raised about two feet and a half high, on which were placed the desks of the entry clerks, leaving room in front of them for the auctioneer and the goods.
At about 11 o'clock, the business men took their places, and announced that the sale would begin. Mr. Bryan, the negro-broker, is a dapper little man, wearing spectacles and a yachting hat, sharp and sudden in his movements, and perhaps the least bit in the world obtrusively officious-as earnest in his language as he could be without actual swearing, though acting much as if he would like to swear a little at the critical moment; in fact, conducting himself very much like a member of the Young Men's Christian Association. Mr. Bryan did not sell the goods, he merely superintended the operation, and saw that the entry clerks did their duty properly. The auctioneer proper was a Mr. Walsh, who deserves a word of description. In personal appearance he is the very opposite of Mr. Bryan, being careless in his dress instead of scrupulous, a large man instead of a little one, a fat man instead of a lean one, and a good-natured man instead of a fierce one. He is a rollicking old boy, with an eye ever on the lookout, and that never lets a bidding nod escape him; a hearty word for every bidder who cares for it, and plenty of jokes to let off when the business gets a little slack. Mr. Walsh has a florid complexion, not more so, perhaps, than is becoming, and possibly not more so than is natural in a whiskey country. Not only is his face red, but his skin has been taken off in spots by blisters of some sort, giving him a peely look; so that, taking his face all in all, the peeliness and the redness combined, he looks much as if he had been boiled in the same pot with a red cabbage.
Mr. Walsh mounted the stand, and announced the terms of the sale, ‘one-third cash, the remainder payable in two equal annual instalments, bearing interest from the day of sale, to be secured by approved mortgage and personal security, or approved acceptances in Savannah, Ga., or Charleston, S. C. Purchasers to pay for papers.' The buyers, who were present to the number of about two hundred, clustered around the platform; while the negroes, who were not likely to be immediately wanted, gathered into sad groups in the background to watch the progress of the selling in which they were so sorrowfully interested. The wind howled outside, and through the open side of the building the driving rain came pouring in; the bar down stairs ceased for a short time its brisk trade; the buyers lit fresh cigars, got ready their catalogues and pencils, and the first lot of human chattels was led upon the stand, not by a white man, but by a sleek mulatto, himself a slave, and who seemed to regard the selling of his brethren, in which he so glibly assisted, as a capital joke. It had been announced that the negroes would be sold in ‘families,' that is to say, a man would not be parted from his wife, or a mother from a very young child. There is perhaps as much policy as humanity in this arrangement, for thereby many aged and unserviceable people are disposed of, who otherwise would not find a ready sale. 
The first family brought out were announced on the catalogue as
NAME. AGE. REMARKS.
1. George 27 Prime Cotton Planter.
2. Sue 26 Prime Rice Planter.
3. George 6 Boy Child.
4. Harry 2 Boy Child.
The manner of buying was announced to be, bidding a certain price apiece for the whole lot. Thus George and his family were started at $300, and were finally sold at $600 each, being $2,400 for the four. To get an idea of the relative value of each one, we must suppose George worth $1,200, Sue worth $900, little George worth $200, and Harry worth $100. Owing, however, to some misapprehension on the part of the buyer as to the manner of bidding, he did not take the family at this figure, and they were put up and sold again, on the second day, when they brought $620 each, or $2,480 for the whole-an advance of $80 over the first sale.
Robert and Luna his wife, who were announced as having ‘goitre, otherwise very prime,' brought the round sum of $1,005 each.

It seems as if every shade of character capable of being implicated in the sale of human flesh and blood was represented among the buyers. There was the Georgia fast young man, with his pantaloons tucked into his boots, his velvet cap jauntily dragged over to one side, his cheek full of tobacco, which he bites from a huge plug, that resembles more than any thing else an old bit of a rusty wagon tire, and who is altogether an animal of quite a different breed from your New York fast man. His ready revolver or his convenient knife is ready for instant use in case of a heated argument. White neck-clothed, gold-spectacled, and silver-haired old men were there, resembling in appearance that noxious breed of sanctimonious deacons we have at the North, who are perpetually leaving documents at your door that you never read, and the business of whose mendicant life it is to eternally solicit subscriptions for charitable associations, of which they are treasurers. These gentry, with quiet step and subdued voice, moved carefully about among the live stock, ignoring, as a general rule, the men, but tormenting the women with questions which, when accidentally overheard by the disinterested spectator, bred in that spectator's mind an almost irresistible desire to knock somebody down. And then, all imaginable varieties of rough backwoods rowdies, who began the day in a spirited manner, but who, as its hours progressed, and their practice at the bar became more prolific in results, waxed louder and talking and more violent, were present, and added a characteristic feature to the assemblage. Those of your readers who have read' Uncle Tom'-and who has not?-will remember, with peculiar feelings, Legree, the slave-driver and woman-whipper. That that character is not over-drawn or too highly colored, there is abundant testimony. Witness the subjoined dialogue: A party of men were conversing on the fruitful subject of managing refractory' niggers'; some were for severe whipping, some recommended branding, one or two advocated other modes of torture, but one huge brute of a man, who had not taken an active part in the discussion, save to assent with approving nod to any unusually barbarous proposition, at last broke his silence by saying, in an oracular way, You may say what you like about managing niggers; I'm a driver myself, and I've had some experience, and I ought to know. You can manage ordinary niggers by lickin' ’em, and givin' ’em a taste of the hot iron once in awhile when they're extra ugly; but if a nigger really sets himself up against me, I can't never have any patience with him. I just get my pistol, and shoot him right down; and that's the best way.'
And this brute was talking to gentlemen, and his remarks were listened to with attention, and his assertions assented to by more than one in the knot of listeners. But all this time the sale was going on, and the merry Mr. Walsh, with many a quip and jest, was beguiling the time when the bidding was slow. The expression on the faces of all who stepped on the block was always the same, and told of more anguish than it is in the power of words to express. Blighted homes, crushed hopes and broken hearts was the sad story to be read in all the anxious faces. Some of them regarded the sale with perfect indifference, never making a motion save to turn from one side to the other at the word of the dapper Mr. Bryan, that all the crowd might have a fair view of their proportions, and then, when the sale was accomplished, stepped down from the block without caring to cast even a look at the buyer, who now held all their happiness in his hands. Others, again, strained their eyes with eager glances from one buyer to another as the bidding went on, trying with earnest attention to follow the rapid voice of the auctioneer. Sometimes, two persons only would be bidding for the same chattel, all the others having resigned the contest, and then the poor creature on the block, conceiving an instantaneous preference for one of the buyers over the other, would regard the rivalry with the intensest interest, the expression of his face changing with every bid, settling into a half smile of joy if the favorite buyer persevered unto the end and secured the property, and settling down into a look of hopeless despair if the other won the victory.
DAPHNEY'S BABY.
The family of Primus, plantation carpenter, consisting of Daphney, his wife, with her young babe, and Dido, a girl of three years old, were reached in due course of time. Daphney had a large shawl, which she kept carefully wrapped round her infant and herself. This unusual proceeding attracted much attention, and provoked many remarks, such as these:
'What do you keep your nigger covered up for? Pull off her blanket.'
'What's the matter with the gal? Has she got the headache? What's the fault of the gal? Ain't she sound? Pull off her rags, and let us see her.'
'Who's going to bid on that nigger, if you keep her covered up? Let's see her face.'
And a loud chorus of similar remarks' emphasized with profanity, and mingled with sayings too indecent and obscene to be even hinted at here, went up from the crowd of chivalrous Southern gentlemen.
At last, the auctioneer obtained a hearing long enough to explain that there was no attempt to practice any deception in the case-the parties were not to be wronged in any way; he had no desire to palm off on them an inferior article; but the truth of the matter was, that Daphney had been confined only fifteen days ago, and he thought that on that account she was entitled to the slight indulgence of a blanket, to keep from herself and child the chill air and the driving rain.
Will your lady readers look at the circumstances of this case? The day was the 2d day of March. Daphney's baby was born into the world on St. Valentine's happy day, the 14th of February. Since her confinement, Daphney had travelled from the plantation to Savannah, where she had been kept in a shed for six days. On the sixth or seventh day after her sickness, she had left her bed, taken a railroad journey across the country to the shambles, was
<c05>
there exposed for six days to the questionings and insults of the negro speculators, and then on the fifteenth day after her confinement was put upon the block, with her husband and her other child, and with her new-born baby in her arms, sold to the highest bidder.
It was very considerate of Daphney to be sick before the sale, for her wailing babe was worth to Mr. Butler all of a hundred dollars. The family sold for $625 apiece, or $2,500 for the four.
BOB AND MARY.
This was a couple not quite a year married, and were down in the catalogue as ‘prime.' They had no children yet; Mary, with a reprehensible lack of that tender interest in Mr. Butler's affairs that had been exhibited in so eminent a degree by Daphney, had disappointed that worthy man's expectations, and the baby as yet was not. But Bob and Mary sold for $1,135 apiece, for all that.
In another instance, Margaret, the wife of Doctor George, who was confined on February 16, though the name of herself and family were inserted in the catalogue, did not come to the sale, and, consequently, they were not disposed of at all. As Margaret's baby was fully four days old at the time she was required to start on her journey to Savannah, we can only look at her refusal to go as a most culpable instance of perversity. Margaret should be whipped, and branded, and otherwise kindly admonished of her great sin in thus disappointing the reasonable expectations of so kind a master. But Mr. Butler bore with her in a truly Christian spirit, and uttered no reproach-in public at least. It was the more unkind of Margaret, too, because there were six in the family who would have brought, probably, $4,000; and all were detained from the sale by the contumacy of misguided Margaret.
While on the subject of babies, it may be mentioned that Amity, chattel No. 316, wife of Prince, chattel No. 315, had testified her earnest desire to contribute all in her power to the worldly wealth of her master, by bringing into the world at one time chattels Nos. 317 and 318, being a fine pair of twin boys, just a year old. It is not in evidence that Amity received from her master any testimonial of his appreciating her good behavior on this occasion, but it is certain that she brought a great price, the four, Prince, Amity and the twins selling for $670 apiece, being a total of $2,680.
Many other babies, of all ages of babyhood, were sold, but there was nothing particularly interesting about them. There were some thirty babies in the lot; they are esteemed worth to the master a hundred dollars the day they are born, and to increase in value at the rate of a hundred dollars a year till they are sixteen or seventeen years old, at which age they bring the best prices.
THE LOVE STORY OF JEFFREY AND DORCAS.
Jeffrey, chattel No. 319, marked a ‘prime cotton hand,' aged 23 years, was put up. Jeffrey being a likely lad, the competition was high. The first bid was $1,100, and he was finally sold for $1,310. Jeffrey was sold alone; he had no incumbrance in the shape of an aged father or mother, who must necessarily be sold with him; nor had he any children, for Jeffrey was not married. But Jeffrey, chattel No. 319, being human in his affections, had dared to cherish a love for Dorcas, chattel No. 278; and Dorcas, not having the fear of her master before her eyes, had given her heart to Jeffrey. Whether what followed was a just retribution on Jeffrey and Dorcas, for daring to take such liberties with their master's property as to exchange hearts, or whether it only goes to prove that with black as well as white the saying holds that' the course of true love never did run smooth,' cannot now be told. Certain it is that these two lovers were not to realize the consummation of their hopes in happy wedlock. Jeffrey and Dorcas had told their loves, had exchanged their simple vows, and were betrothed, each to the other as dear, and each by the other as fondly beloved, as though their skins had been of fairer color. And who shall say that, in the sight of Heaven and all holy angels, these two hearts were not as closely wedded as any two of the prouder race that call them slaves?
Be that as it may, Jeffrey was sold. He finds out his new master; and, hat in hand, the big tears standing in his eyes, and his voice trembling with emotion, he stands before that master, and tells his simple story, praying that his betrothed may be bought with him. Though his voice trembles, there is no embarrassment in his manner; his fears have killed all the bashfulness that would naturally attend such a recital to a stranger, and before unsympathizing witnesses: he feels that he is pleading for the happiness of her he loves, as well as for his own, and his tale is told in a frank and manly way.
'I loves Dorcas, young mas'r; I loves her well an' true; she says she loves me, and I know she does; de good Lord knows I loves her better than I loves any one in de wide world-never can love another woman half so well. Please buy Dorcas, mas'r. We're be good sarvants to you as long as we live. We're be married right soon, young mas'r, and de chillun will be healthy and strong, mas'r, and dey'll be good sarvants, too. Please buy Dorcas, young mas'r. We loves each other a heap-do, really, true, mas'r.'
Jeffrey then remembers that no loves and hopes of his are to enter into the bargain at all, but in the earnestness of his love, he has forgotten to base his plea on other ground till now, when he bethinks him, and continues, with his voice not trembling now, save with eagerness to prove how worthy of many dollars is the maiden of his heart:
' Young mas'r, Dorcas prime woman-A 1 woman, sa. Tall gall, sa; long arms, strong, healthy, and can do a heap of work in a day. She is one of de best rice hands on de whole plantation: worth $1,200 easy, mas'r, an' fus'-rate bargain at that.'
The man seems touched by Jeffrey's last remarks, and bids him fetch out his ‘gal, and let's see what she looks like.'
Jeffrey goes into the long room, and presently returns with Dorcas, looking very sad and self-possessed, without a particle of embarrassment at the trying position in which she is placed. She makes the accustomed curtsy, and stands meekly with her hands clasped across her bosom, waiting the result. The buyer regards her with a critical eye, and growls in a low voice that the' gal has good p'ints.' Then he goes on to a more minute and careful examination of her working abilities. He turns her round, makes her stoop, and walk; and then takes off her turban to look at her head that no wound or disease be concealed by the gay handkerchief; he looks at her teeth, and feels of her arms, and at last 
announces himself pleased with the result of his observations; whereat Jeffrey, who has stood near, trembling with eager hope, is overjoyed, and he smiles for the first time. The buyer then crowns Jeffrey's happiness by making a promise that he will buy her, if the price isn't run up too high. And the two lovers step aside and congratulate each other on their good fortune. But Dorcas is not to be sold till the next day, and there are twenty-four long hours of feverish expectation.
Early next morning is Jeffrey alert, and hat in hand, encouraged to unusual freedom by the greatness of the stake for which he plays, he addresses every buyer, and of all who listen he begs the boon of a word to be spoken to his new master to encourage him to buy Dorcas. And all the long morning he speaks in his homely way with all who know him, that they will intercede to save his sweet-heart from being sold away from him forever. No one has the heart to deny a word of promise and encouragement to the poor fellow, and joyous with so much kindness, his hopes and spirits gradually rise until he feels almost certain that the wish of his heart will be accomplished. And Dorcas, too, is smiling, for is not Jeffrey's happiness her own?
At last comes the trying moment, and Dorcas steps upon the stand.
But now a most unexpected feature in the drama is for the first time unmasked: Dorcas is not to be sold alone, but with a family of four others. Full of dismay, Jeffrey looks to his master, who shakes his head; for although he might be induced to buy Dorcas alone, he has no use for the rest of the family. Jeffrey reads his doom in his master's look, and turns away, the tears streaming down his honest face.
So Dorcas is sold, and her toiling life is to be spent in the cotton fields of South Carolina, while Jeffrey goes to the rice plantation of the Great Swamp.
And to-morrow, Jeffrey and Dorcas are to say their tearful farewell, and go their separate ways in life, to meet no more as mortal beings.
But didn't Mr. Pierce Butler give them a silver dollar apiece? Who shall say there is no magnanimity in slave-owners?
In another hour I see Dorcas in the long room, sitting motionless as, a statue, with her head covered with a shawl. And I see Jeffrey, who goes to his new master, pulls off his hat and says, I'se very much obliged, mas'r, to you for tryin' to help
<c06>
me. I knows you would have done it if you could thank you, mas'r-thank you-but--it's berry-hard'-and here the poor fellow breaks down entirely and walks away, covering his face with his battered hat, and sobbing like a very child.
He is soon surrounded by a group of his colored friends, who, with an instinctive delicacy most unlooked for, stand quiet, and with uncovered heads
about him. 
Anson and Violet, chattels Nos. 111 and 112, were sold for $250 each, both being old, and Anson being down in the catalogue as ‘ruptured, and as having one eye.' Violet was sold as being sick. Her disease was probably consumption, which supposition gave rise to the following feeling conversation between two buyers:
'Cheap gal that, Major.'
'Don't think so. They may talk about her being sick; it is no easy sickness she's got. She's got consumption, and the man that buys her'll have to be a doctorin' her all the time, and she'll die in less than three months. I won't have anything to do with her-don't want any half-dead niggers about me.' 
THE MARKET VALUE OF AN EYE.
Guy, chattel No. 419, ‘a prime young man,' sold for $1,280, being without blemish; his age was twenty years, and he was altogether a fine article. His next door neighbor, Andrew, chattel No. 420, was his very counterpart in all marketable points in size, age, skill, and everything save that he had lost his right eye. Andrew sold for only $1,040, from which we argue that the market value of the right eye in the Southern country is $240.
AN UNEXPECTED MARRIAGE.
When the family of Mingo, consisting of his wife, two sons and a daughter, was called for it was announced by the auctioneer that chattel No.322, Dembo, the eldest son, aged 20, had the evening before procured the services of a minister and been joined in wedlock to chattel No. 404, Frances, and that he should be compelled to put up the bride and groom in one lot. They were called up, and as was to be expected, their appearance was the signal for avolley of coarse jokes from the auctioneer, and of ribald remarks from the surrounding crowd. The newly married pair bore it bravely, although one refined gentleman took hold of Frances's lips, and pulled them apart, to see her age. 
This sort of thing it is that makes Northern blood boil, and Northern fists clench with a laudable de sire to hit somebody. It was almost too much for endurance to stand and see those brutal slave-drivers pushing the women about, pulling their lips apart with their not too cleanly hands, and committing many another indecent act, while the husbands, fathers and brothers of those women were compelled to witness these things, without the power to resent the outrage.
Dembo and Frances were at last struck off for $1,320 each, and went’ to spend their honeymoon on a cotton plantation in Alabama.
THE CASE OF JOSHUA'S MOLLY.
The auctioneer brought up Joshua's Molly and family. He announced that Molly insisted that she was lame in her left foot, and perversely would walk lame, although, for his part, he did not believe a word of it. He had caused her to be examined by an eminent physician in Savannah, which medical light had declared that Joshua's Molly was not lame, but was only shamming. However, the gentlemen must judge for themselves and bid accordingly. So Molly was put through her paces, and compelled to trot up and down along the stage, to go up and down the steps, and to exercise her feet in various ways, but always with the same result, the left foot would be lame. She was finally sold for $695.
Whether she really was lame or not, no one knows I but herself, but it must be remembered that to a slave a lameness, or anything that decreases his market value, is a thing to be rejoiced over. A man in the prime of life, worth $1,600 or there abouts, can have little hope of ever being able, by any little savings of his own, to purchase his liberty. But let him have a rupture, or lose a limb, or sustain any other injury that renders him of much less service to his owner, and reduces his value to $300 or $400, and he may hope to accumulate that sum, and eventually to purchase his liberty. Freedom without health is infinitely sweeter than health without freedom.
And so the Great Sale went on for two long days, during which time there were sold 429 men, women and children. There were 436 announced to be sold, but a few were detained on the plantations by sickness.
At the close of the sale, on the last day, several baskets of champagne were produced, and all were I invited to partake, the wine being at the expense of the broker, Mr. Bryan.
The total amount of the sale foots up $303,850 the proceeds of the first day being $161,480, and of the second day $142,370.
The highest sum paid for any one family was given for Sally Walker and her five children, who were mostly grown up. The price was $6,180.
The highest price paid for a single man was $1,750, which was given for William, a' fair carpenter and caulker.'
The highest price paid for a woman was $1,250, which was given for Jane,' cotton hand, and house servant.'
The lowest price paid was for Anson and Violet, a grey-haired couple, each having numbered more than fifty years; they brought but $250 a piece.
MR. BUTLER GIVES HIS PEOPLE A DOLLAR APIECE.
Leaving the Race buildings where’ the scenes we have described took place, a crowd of negroes were seen gathered eagerly about a white man. That man was Pierce M. Butler of the free city of Philadelphia, who was solacing the wounded hearts of the people he had sold from their firesides and their homes, by doling out to them small change at the rate of a dollar a head. To every negro he had sold, who presented his claim fur the paltry pittance, he gave the munificent stipend of one whole dollar, in specie; he being provided with two canvas bags of 25 cent pieces, fresh from, the mint, to give additional glitter to his generosity. 
And now come the scenes of the last partings-of the final separations of those who were akin, or who had been such dear friends from youth that no ties of kindred could bind them closer-of those who were all in all to each other, and for whose bleeding hearts there shall be no earthly comfort-the parting of parents and children, of brother from brother, and the rending of sister from a sister's bosom; and O, hardest, cruellest of all, the tearing asunder of loving hearts, wedded in all save the one ceremony of the Church, these scenes pass all description: it is not meet for pen to meddle with tears so holy.
As the last family stepped down from the block, the rain ceased; for the first time in four days the clouds broke away, and the soft sunlight fell on the scene. The unhappy slaves had many of them been already removed, and others were now departing with their new masters. 
That night, not a steamer left that Southern port, not a train of cars sped away from that cruel city, that did not bear each its own sad burden of those unhappy ones, whose only crime is that they are not strong and wise. Some of them maimed and wounded, some scarred and gashed, by accident or by the hand of ruthless drivers-all sad and sorrowful as human hearts can be. 
But the stars shone out as brightly as if such things had never been, the blushing fruit trees poured their fragrance on the evening air, and the scene was as calmly sweet and quiet as if Man had never marred the glorious beauty of Earth by deeds of cruelty and wrong.

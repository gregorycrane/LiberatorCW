SPEECH OF THE VIRGINIA MADCAP, GOV. WISE
The Reception of the Southern Medical Students in Richmond from Philadelphia-Threatened War against England and the Northern Abolitinists-&c., &c., &c.
Correspondence of the New York Herald.
RICHMOND, Va., Dec. 22, 1859.
Two hundred of the Southern medical students arrived here, yesterday, from Philadelphia by the Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad. They were met at the depot by the Faculty of the Medical College of this city, the attaches thereof, and a deputation from the Southern Rights Association, all wearing rosettes and ribbons of different colors to distinguish them from the mass of citizens who were present. The train reached here about half past three o'clock in the afternoon, when the delegatious formed into line, and proceeded with the students towards the Executive mansion, to pay their respects to the Governor. For fully two hours before the cars arrived, the streets along the region of the depot were literally blocked up with the crowd assembled to witness the arrival. The enthusiasm displayed, as the train neared the depot, surpassed anything I have seen for some time. Along the route, from the cars to the Executive mansion, an incessant cheering was kept up. Our most respectable citizens engaged in the reception ceremony, and so great seems to be the satisfaction which this love has afforcied, that any amount of money could be raised here to do whatever would be deemed necessary to contribute to the comfort of these new <illegible>. As the procession entered the square, it moved towards the Washington monument, and after marching round it to afford the students an opportunity of seeing the statues, it moved on towards the Governor's mansion.
SPEECH OF GOV. WISE.
Just as the procession formed in front of the mansion, some one in the crowd called for three cheers for Governor Wise, which were given in tones that <illegible> far and wide. The Governor was standing in front of the mansion door, and when the cheering <illegible>, he descended the steps and took his stand upon a granite-block in the sidewalk, which is used <illegible> carriage-step. Here, again, the cheering was <illegible> and kept up for fully five minutes, the lades meanwhile waving their handkerchiefs from windows of the houses outside the line of Capital square. Never have I witnessed such a degree of <illegible> as hailed the Governor's presence.-Cheer after cheer was thundered forth from the immense assemblage, in which the medical students <illegible> heartily. So great was the anxiety to hear him that the crowd was not content to keep at any reasonable distance from him, but rushed in a mass <illegible> the step upon which he stood. In fact, the greater portion of the space fronting the Executive <illegible> was occupied long before the regular entered. The members of both houses of the Legislature were present, and joined warmly in the applause. As soon as order was restored, Gov.<illegible> said:-
Sons of Virginia, who come back to us from Philadelphia, we welcome you! [Cries of 'higher up, 'higher up!'] The Governor here changed his, position, and ascended the steps leading to the <illegible> entrance of the building, when he again <illegible> his speech. Sons of Virginia and of the <illegible>. I say, who come back to Virginia, we welcome you. [Applause.] You come back to a <illegible> mother-a mother of whom you may well be proud. She has populated the South, she has populated the Southwest; she has given to the nation the whole Northwest to the Mississippi; she <illegible> sent her sons to colleges to learn and enlighten; she has given her children, her treasure, her blood, <illegible> such talent and virtue as no State ever gave to a common country. From Washington down, she has given to this common country the chief elements which form the basis of its grandeur and is greatness. [Applause.] Bound to Union, bound is in devotion to self-sacrifice, she has done what would have exhausted any other people-she has built up a nation, and yet is still herself a million and a half strong. [Applause.] Her people have gone to Alabama, to Mississippi, to Louisiana, to <illegible> and to Kentucky; and every State in the Northwest is her offspring. Latterly her professional sons have been in the habit of going to the North to learn the art of curing the human frame. Would to God that the only disease in our country was the physical disease, the natural, the medicable disease which is merely upon the flesh of the children of men! Would to God that all our diseases were medicable, of such only as can reach the <illegible> Art could soothe, if not cure, such diseases. What is now matter with this nation besides <illegible>, besides epidemic, besides those diseases which yield to the art of the Faculty? What is it now that besets this nation, that but yesterday was <illegible> and vigorous as a Hercules in his cradle? What is the matter with our nation, founded by fathers higher, nobler, greater, more glorious than any in Roman or Grecian history? From as we are in our foundation-deep as the earth, high as the heavens, broad, as we thought, as the universe, what is it that now makes the parts of our republic of confederated States fly apart? Oh! God, this looks more like dissolution; this <illegible>more like political death; this looks more like <illegible> of the work of Washington, than anything! have yet seen. Two hundred of Virginia's children come back from a sister State! We welcome you with warm hearts; you shall be taken as to <illegible>of a mother. [Applause.] But, sons of Virginia, why, why could you not live in the <illegible> of a sister State? I say it without <illegible>I say it without stage trick, that at this moment I feel upon me a heaviness, a sadness about our common country I never felt before. Churches I have seen split, but the 'drum <illegible>' tap is <illegible> of bloody war, in the midst of which red battle stamps his foot, and nations feel the shock.' In this contest of the pulpit, it may be a <illegible> controversy-it may be a difference between the elect and the Armenian; it may be difference between the Protestants and the Catholics. These wars are worn out in the would. Separation of churches do not alarm me. But what is this? Without distinction of creed, without distinction of party as one mass, we see our people seperated. As I have said to the military, to day, my friends, I say to you here now in civil life, I mean to stand by my State, I mean to stand by my neighbors, I mean to stand by my rights of Property, I mean to stand by my rights of <illegible>; above all, I mean to stand by my moral rights of honor, and I mean to stand last, but not least, by my political rights in this nation, <illegible> highest of which, in a national point of view, is the Constitution and the Union of these States. [Tremendous applause.] If any black <illegible> if any Abolitionist, if any fanatic, if any fool, if any, worse than fool, if a wicked man among the <illegible> or in the high places of the country, <illegible>
<c02>
to take this Union from me, they shall not do it I will fight first. [Applause.] If the Union is to be dissolved, they shall dissolve it, not I. [Applause.] If any are to be driven from under the flag that floats over that Capitol, and over the Capitol at Washington-the flag of the stars and stripes, under which the Revolutionary war was fought, under which the last war with England was fought, under which the Mexican war was fought, under which every war, so far as I can will it, will be fought-I say, if any are to be driven out, it shall be those who seek to drive me out. [Applause.] Jackson said, and I will repeat his words, 'The Union shall be preserved.' It shall be preserved by force of arms, if in no other way. [Applause.] The moment is come when you must stand united. You have done right, perhaps, my friends. Virginia has been contributing population, blood, treasure, virtue, intellect, everything in short that was necessary to maintain and strengthen this Union. Now let her call home her children, You, my friends, have come back to us, and we embrace you with open arms-[applause]-and standing together, we will strengthen the bands of our State. Let her from that Capitol pass a law that shall build up her highways; let her make the great pathway of trade; let her make her centres of commerce; let her employ her own teachers- (applause)-let her people wear the wool of their, own pastures; let them eat the flour of their own mills, and if they have got no flour, let them eat their own corn cake, as they did in the days of'76. (Laughter and applause.) There was a time when Tarleton saw for himself that Col. Washington's buskins were made of buff; now the Yankees make for us our clothes pins and broom handles, our locomotives, and even our doctors have been made for us at the North. (Laughter.) Everything, everywhere, turn where you will our dairies abound in Yankee churns; in the parlor nothing is to be found but Northern manufactures; turn to the mantel-piece, and every one has a Yankee clock; and so, in fact, in regard to every domestic requirement. I will not advise you to break up all these things now-a-days, because you paid far them; but I will advise you in future either to do without these things-doctors, broom handles and all-or make them your-selves. (Laughter and applause.) Be self-reliant, self-dependent. They have boasted that they have eighteen millions of people against eight; and they speak of those eighteen millions as hard-handed men. If we have not a population that have been pent up in work-shops, we have a population that have grown up in Heaven's sweet air, under Heaven's bright sun, in the corn-field. (Applause.) We have a stalwart, hearty, young, unsophisticated crowd of Virginians here, who have not degenerated. (Applause.) If we had men of old that could fight, we have men now that can fight, [Great applause.] If we had men of old that could speak to the hearts of the people, we have men now that can appeal to the hearts of the people, and we have the people now, as ever, with hearts to appeal to. [Tremendous applause.] Here in the midst of this metropolis is erected an institution of Virginia's own, on the very spot where God has grown the snakeroot to cure the ague and fever. [Laughter and applause.] Then we have a University, a Faculty, a hospital; and will you tell me why Virginia doctors cannot, at home, in Virginia, learn to cure her diseases as well as they can by spending millions in Philadelphia for learning them how to cure disease? I was frequently sick in Philadelphia, and have had the doctors there waiting upon me. On one of those occasions, I had no less man than the illustrious Virginian, Nathan Chapman, waiting on me. Mr. Chapman was a most eloquent orator, and as eloquent in colloquy, and I was too sick to relish his colloquy. On one occasion I got tired of his conversation, and said to him, 'Doctor, have you no patients to attend?' Says he,' Sir,' in his nasal tone, 'I have killed almost all, and cured the rest.' [Laughter.] Said I,' Sir, have you no lectures to write? for God's sake leave me alone.' Says he?' Sir, I wrote my lectures forty years ago, and I only have now to furbish them up with a few new anecdotes.' [Laughter.]'Doctor,' said I,' will that do in this enlightened age?' 'Yes,' said he,' it is good enough to make corn crackers for Virginia.' [Loud laughter.]
There is more philosophy in this anecdote than perhaps you may now likely give to it. Those high pretending institutions, after they get their fame up, have more of pretension about them than there is of reality in them. The institution that is young; the institution that is rising; the institution that is to make a reputation, is the one where, if you are earnest and zealous in your search after science, you will derive most benefit. The school that is unknown and unsung to fame-there is the place to get the waters of the true Pierian spring. One of the best scholars that ever Virginia could boast of-I mean that great, that illustrious citizen of this town, Benjamin Watkins Leigh, was the only man I ever saw in America that pronounced a-c-c-e-p-t-a-b-l-e correctly. That man told me what the correct pronunciation was. I replied,' Walker don't say so.' 'I don't care for Walker, sir, 'said he.' Then,' said I,' Johnson don't say so.' ' I don't care,' said he,' for what Johnson says.' 'Well, then,' said I 'who is your authority?' Needler Robertson,' was the reply. 'Who is he?'' An old field schoolmaster,' said he,' of olden times, in the county of Chesterfield.' Needler Robertson was one of that class of the old field caste in Virginia that made the men of Virginia in the olden times-that made the best statesmen, the best scholars, the best lawyers, the best patriots, the most illustrious sages and heroes that ever gave force and effect to the Revolution. And I have no doubt that here in Richmond science can be taught as well as in Philadelphia. (Applause.) Let us have it. Let us have science of our own; let us have arts of our own; let us have manufactures of our own; let us have trade of our own; let us have ships of our own; let us always be self-reliant and self-dependent, and then you will not have other people grow so great upon our wealth that they undertake to play the part of petty providence for God Almighty himself. (Applause.) They will then attend to their own business, and let our affairs alone. And if they cannot attend to their business-if they cannot discontinue their vicious intermeddling with us-we will make them do it. (Applause.) If we cannot do that by peaceful and self-reliant means, why. as you are aware, gentlemen, a little blood-letting, a little phlebotomy, will reduce the fever. (Laughter.) I tell you now-though I do not send it as a message to the Legislature of Virginia, for it is not my part to do so-that, if blood must flow, if the tocsin of war must be sounded, if we must buckle on our armory, if redbattle will stamp his foot, this nation alone shall not feel the shock. The real groundwork of dissention in this country, the real cause, the real root of the disease, is the foreign influence of Great Britain. Your internal commerce, your exports and imports, the constant intercourse between New England and Old England, beget a sympathy between Old and New England stronger, I sometimes fear, than the sympathy which New England feels for us. And whenever New England fanaticism joins with Old English intolerance in an effort to dissolve this Union-any effort like that of which John Brown was the
<c03>
<illegible>-New England and Old England<illegible>not <illegible> to drive me from the Union. No! (With God's help we will drive all the disunionists together back into Canada. Let them join Canada; let the compact of fanaticism and intolerance be confined to British soil. As for me, I mean to stay here. (Laughter and applause.) I mean to stay here, I say, with one exception. If invasion shall ever again cross the Northern border of Virginia, and I can get one hundred men-aye, or ten men-to follow me, whether the Legislature authorizes it or not, I will go North; and if the Southern people are the men of purpose, if the Southern people are the men of will, if the Southern people are the men of moral power that I take them to be, then, rather than let this Union be dissolved, they will drive into Canada every black republican, every abolitionist, every Northern disunionist, who, like Wendell Phillips, utters the sentiments-or, worse than Wendell Phillips-that Senator from <illegible> who gives sanction to the sentiment uttered by Wendell Phillips in New York that a slave has a right to throttle his master, and if he makes his way over dead bodies from Virginia to Canada, he has a right to do so; as if in passing from Virginia to Canada, with hands dripping with the blood of his master, he knocks at the door of Wendell Phillips or Henry Wilson, and asks for admission, they will open the door to the 'bloody hands.' I say that when sentiments like these are uttered by Wendell Phillips, and he is protected by a guard of seventyfive policemen under the Mayor of New York, it is time for the medical students to come home to be allowed, I hope, to study their professions in peace, and if not allowed to pursue their vocations in peace, to quit the vocation of peace for the panoply of war. (Tremendous applause.) And here understand me. I am not speaking against the whole North when I speak against Wendell Phillips and Henry Wilson. No; come what will-come the worst that can come, and when it does come we will find patriots there, in a minority, if not a majority. (Loud applause.) This patriotic minority will help us to give the enemies of the Constitution and the Union their hands full at home. (Applause.) However that may be, I will not be content to fight the battle upon ground south of Mason and Dixon's line, norshall it be confined to ground north of that line within the Union. It shall be carried into Canada. (Tremendous applause, which lasted several minutes.) It shall not only involve the Northern States, but England. (Applause.) Let her furnish any longer an asylum for Fred. Douglass to fly into; let her furnish a depot for the provisional government of John Brown at Chatham; let her nurse the viper of civil war; let her nurse our fugitives from labor and fugitives from justice, whom she holds to let loose upon us; let her hold in reserve those pirates and cut-throats who carry on a contraband trade between New England and Canada-men that would scuttle a ship or cut a throat with a placid smile; let her make Canada the centre of a provisional government for men of this class, and you will have, my fellow-citizens, not only to war with the abolitionists of the North, but you will have to war with England-(applause) -and that war would be easily brought on. Fred. Douglass, the fugitive negro-Fred. Douglass that came with John Brown's party as far South as Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and then fled back to Canada; this negro has published his proclamation against Governor Wise. (Laughter and applause.) He has said that he has no idea of going back to New York or Pennsylvania for fear that Governor Wise, through federal agents, will bag him. (Laughter.) I will never put my hemp in the form of a bag for him; it shall be in the shape of a rope. (Laughter.) And he thinks he is safe when he is in Canada. It would be with an aching heart, it would be with a wild fever passion, that I could be forced to strike against the bosom of my own countrymen of New England, New York, Pennsylvania or Ohio, but if I could only be relieved from that struggle, I would gladly take the alternative of a war with England. (Applause.) My heart would leap to that alternative like a bridegroom to his chamber. (Applause.) Fred. Douglass says that he is bound for England. Let him. Oh! if I had had one good long, low, black, rakish, well-armed steamer in Hampton roads I would have placed her on the Newfoundland banks with orders that if she found a British packet with that negro on board, to tike him. (Tremendous applause.) And by the eternal gods, he should have been taken-taken with very particular instructions not to hang him before I had the privilege of seeing him well hung (Laughter and applause.) Then, then, if Queen Victoria called upon my prince, Mr. Buchanan-(the remainder of this sentence was lost in the applause.) I hope he would have said that all he could do was what he said he could do at Harper's Ferry. (Laughter.) If the British minister had demanded that this madcap Governor should be given to the British lion, I would just deliberately have referred the question to you. (Tremendous applause.) I should have said to them,' Come up and take me, and if my people are willing that I shall be surrendered, I will go without a fuss.' (Laughter and applause.) Go to the library in that Capitol, and ask for the last London Punch. Look at the last page. I hope the members of the Legislature have seen it. There is in the air a black eagle-that is the South-and a white eagle-that is the North-and they are fighting in the air above this English print. The black eagle is held by a talon grasping his vitals, and the beak of the white is upon his head. He is under the white, and falling. Below is a lion, with his claws clutching an elk, but his attention is drawn from his prey, he is looking up at the war between the eagles; and underneath is the single word watch!' It is the most significant photograph that could be presented to the eyes of the American people. The North and the South-the black and white eagles-are set by foreign influence beak and bill and talons fighting each other, while the British lion waits over his own prey for them to fall. No, I must watch, I am watching, and the black and the white eagles shall not fight No, and so help me God, if strife must come, they shall both be made to light upon the back of the lion itself. This will wake up the patriots of the North. (Tremendous applause.) There are some left there, and I appeal to the President of the United States to remember that so sure as there is a war between the black and white eagles, the lion is watching; and I would call upon him to notify the British government that their asylum of fugitives from labor and from justice shall not be allowed to foster dissension and disunion in the United States. (Applause.) That is the true policy, and that will save the country. (Applause.) You will be a nation yet united. (Applause.) I care not for France, Austria or Russia; we are impregnable (Applause.) We are invincible. (Applause.) They talk about the' irrepressible conflict.' Let it be irrepressible; let it come. That constitution, that Union, will triumph, as it has always triumphed. (Applause.) It cannot be. Look at that figure on that monument (referring to the equestrian statue of Washington,) and tell me whether mortal power in this country can, by a single blow, strike down that outstretched f arm as long as the arm of that monument is upheld, pointing you to the honor, interest and glory of our country? As long as that arm is upheld by the
<c04>
brawny arms and patriotism of this people, the North and South will unite to drive every scoundrel traitor out of it, until the country is made safer yet. (Applause.) Let you and me stand together, and our country will yet be safe. (Applause.) And we may pursue our vocations, the mechanic arts or professions, whatever they may be, in peace, as we have pursued them, until again as in the natural tendency of nations, peace and plenty and proud pre-eminence shall reign, and she become so fat as to begin to kick again. (Applause, and laughter.)
We are so great, so unconquerable in our power, so independent in our wealth, that we become impatient and restless. Look at the population of Virginia-look at her means-look at her plantations -look at her rising cities-look at her metropolis growing in its gigantic proportions-look at her great West that is now beginning to wake up, and look rich and blooming. (Applause.) Look at old Virginia turning green again with a hue more beautiful than that of the green valley of the Nile. (Applause.) Her people were never more intelligent-her people were never in better spirits-they have all the provisions of peace, and all the munitions of war. We say the tobacco belongs to Virginia --Louisiana says the cotton belongs to her. It is not true. New England says the loom belongs to her. This is not so. They are but filaments of interest, elements which enter from North to South and from South to North; so that they cannot be rent asunder without destroying the vital functions of both. (Loud applause.) The cotton is raised by the Southern planters, but the cotton gin and spinning jenny of Northern manufacture, are elements of its production and perfecting. The hoe and the plough, of Northern manufacture, enter into the planting of the tobacco in Virginia. If the people of New England make the loom and the broom-handles (laughter), the cotton and tobacco are produced in the South, and enter into the manufacture of the loom and the broom-handles. We are united by all the reciprocities of interests-we ought to be united by the Revolutionary recollections of our common sufferings and common glory in the past. (Applause.) These Northern abolitionists are the disunionists, and if their own authorities don't make them behave themselves, we will have the power to do so. What shall be done? In the first place, I would tell the Yankees, you can't have those five millions worth of oysters you take yearly out of the Chesapeake Bay any longer. -I would tell them that they could have no longer the half a million a year they get by insurance out of Virginia. Let all who desire to insure their lives or property, do so on the responsibility of the State, and pay the premium into that treasury. I would not only save the oysters and insurance money, but the coal that is embedded in the earth. (Applause.) I have been signing patents for the last three months for the county of Ritchie, lands which contain unlimited quantities of the best gas-generating coal in the world, and if you ask who own them, you will find that they are chiefly in the possession of Northern men, or at least will be before twelve months. They buy land at two cents an acre, and one peck of the Ritchie coal will thus pureuase a whole acre of land. I would possess ourselves of these sources of wealth. I would then arm the people. I would appoint a committee to examine the statutes of the Northern States that are hostile to our constitutional rights. The statutes are to be found in the library of this State. I would lay my hand upon these statutes ready armed. I would say-'Repeal these statutes.' I would repeat it, repeat it, repeat it; and after making these demands three times, I would say-'Repeal it at your peril.' I would say to the Northern conservative men-' You must fight single-handed in future, and maintain those conservative principles which you profess to respect. 'I would say to the North-'You shall quit warring upon us.' I would call, above all, upon the President of the United States to demand of England that she should not suffer her Canadian possessions to be used as a place of refuge for violators of our laws and disturbers of our peace.
A VOICE IN THE CROWD-Will you make this demand in 1861 if you are elected President?
Gov. WISE-All I have got to say in reply to that is, just try me. (Tremendous applause.) If you want to find that out, all you have to do is to put me there. (Applause and laughter.) I will tell you, my friends, I won't let a Virginia regiment pass three times back and forward by the White House, without poking my head out of the window and asking:-'Brothers, what's the matter?'- (Tremendous applause.) I have detained you too long. All I have to say to the people at large is, that is a proud satisfaction, coming in as I did into this office four years ago, with our people nearly divided in twain by a mere political question-not withstanding the hot campaign of 55, notwithstanding the hard things that might have been said on both sides. I am proud, to-day, to feel, on that head, that whenever war may come from outside, we will, Whig and Democrat, Know-Nothing and Know-Everything, no matter what party we belong to, or who we are, we will stand one solid mass of brothers united on the right hand and on the left. (Tremendous applause.) I give my hand to each of my fellow-citizens, and to all of you I can say, however you may have differed from me, you have given me your cordial support and co-operation in the hour of trial.
A VOICE-We are all with you now.
Gov. W.-I have tried to demonstrate to all, of all parties, that, at all events, I am a Virginian. (Applause.) Without respect to persons or party, I tried faithfully, justly, impartially, without favor, but not without affection, to do my duty. (Tremendous applause.) Tomorrow morning I shall take my leave of you. I am sorry that I have not more time to spend with the young gentlemen who come back to their nursing mother; but I hope that God's blessing may rest upon you; that every man of you may be made, in the hands of God and in your own virtues, a blessing to your State, to cure her disease in peace, or to apply the lint and the tourniquet in war. (Applause.) And I trust that the God of battles-that God who preserved Washington to be worthy of a perennial monument-will still guard our country, and preserve it in peace. (Loud applause.) If war comes, may He preserve us, our hearths and our homes, and enable us to stand the brunt of any trial we may be called upon to meet. I feel ready, and I hope that every man, in his private and public capacity, will not only bind on himself his armor and shoulder his musket, but that he will make greater preparation still-that he will prepare himself in soul at a crisis like this. (Applause.) May we all be prepared for the worst or best, whatever comes.
The Governor was warmly cheered after the close of his speech.
Dr. Lee, of Alabama, followed in a brief address.
The Mayor, Mr. Mayo, was then called out, and he delivered a very interesting and amusing speech.
The students were then conducted to the Medical College, where a reception address was delivered by Dr. Gibson, a member of the Faculty, which I regret I have not time to write out.
The whole party afterwards sat down to an elegant banquet at the Columbian Hotel.

From the Boston Post.
DR. BETHUNE AND THE MINISTERS.
It is gratifying to see the hostility everywhere arising against those pests. Abolition lecturers, in literary institutions and in pulpit ministrations.-When the condemnation was expressed, at the great Faneuil Hall Union meeting, on 'the fanatical ministers of a false philanthropy,' the immense assembly broke forth into hearty and prolonged applause; and this scene was repeated when Edward Everett, in his speech on the same occasion, alluded to the Abolition work of the pulpit. We see that Dr. Bethune, in his capital speech at the New York Union meeting, gave these Abolition ministers severe raps. The first came in thus:-
'When I saw the call for this meeting, I said I must be there. (Hear, hear, and 'good.') Never-never have I before attended a public meeting in any way political in my life-(cheers)-and I can say with a fair conscience, that no man ever heard me, in any position of life, utter a single word in regard to party politics. (Cheers.) I am by my calling and by my vow a minister of the Gospel of Peace (cheers), and it is as a minister of peace that I am among you to-night. (Great cheering.) It is time that this should be so, when the pulpits of the land are desecrated by appeals to the wildest fanaticism that men can conceive. (The most tremendous applause here followed, enduring for several seconds.)
A Voice from the second tier of boxes-The right man in the right place, this time.
Another voice on the platform-That's so.
Dr. Bethune-When men are praised and honored because they have shown the courage of the bulldog with the bloodthirstiness of the tiger- (cheers again and again)-it is high time then that men who feel themselves impelled by the belief that the Gospel is peace on earth and good will towards men, should act up to the spirit of that teaching. [Applause.]
Well said, Dr. Bethune! His other ministerial allusion was received with similar tokens of approbation, and was made in this way:-
'I belong to a king; I am a monarchist. I am a subject of Jesus Christ. But I must say that there is no more dangerous man than he who uses his sacred office of the ministry to mislead men [tremendous applause, and cries of "Beecher and Cheever"], and carrying them away into anarchy and sedition. [Renewed applause.] I am content with holding no higher position than a minister of Christ, to help men to heaven when they, die, and to keep them in peace when alive.'

A REBUKE ADMINISERED.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 9th, 1859.
We had a scene last night, which I trust may prove a useful warning to the fanatics who are travelling through the country, sowing their seditious sentiments. Mr. H. W. Beecher, of Brooklyn, came over here to lecture for the benefit of his pocket, and announced as his theme,' Heads and Hearts.' As the lecture was given under the auspices of a Society who furnish some decent men as lecturers, Concert Hall was well filled. The illustrious star of the Independent, supposing that his audience were mainly of the abolition and Union-bating strife, went out of his way to glorify John Brown, and to denounce those who had censured him. He was cut short, however, by one of the most violent storms of hisses which were ever aimed at a man who was defying public sentiment and insulting persons who came to a lecture which was avowedly only literary. The uproar for a time created considerable panic. Through the forbearance of those who execrated the sentiments of the speaker, he was allowed to proceed, after a suitable hissing, with his remarks. When Mr. Beecher lectures again in this city, it will be necessary to employ a strong police force to keep order. Will you allow me to ask how a man, who is commanded by an apostle to give his time 'wholly' to his ministry, can find time to go about, not like Him whom he professes to call Master,' doing good,' but fomenting discord? I hope the public rebuke which was administered last evening may prove salutary. x
SOUTHERN SENTIMENT.
From the Richmond Enquirer.
The people of fifteen sovereign States regard the Black Republican leaders as men hostile to their institutions: and, whether or not they have sufficient reason for that opinion, is immaterial; it is a violation of confederate faith in the Northern majority to insist upon the election of any man for whom so large a minority of the States have so decided a distrust. And, when informed of this wide-spread distrust, the election of such objectionable men is an overt art of sectional violence, an indication of hostility, which only awaits the machinery of Government to carry out the bloody programme of negro freedom. To permit this sectional leader to possess himself of the Federal Government would be to acquiesce in an act violative of confederate faith, and to arm our open and avowed enemies with the weapons framed by our forefathers for our defence, and to invite them by our supineness to make the assault.
The South is advised to await the' overt act' that assails her rights. She will not permit the 'overt act,' but prevent it by resisting the power to commit the treason. The South will not wait for Black Republicanism to arm itself with the powers of the Federal Government, and then begin the work of disunion; but, by resisting prevent the Black Republicans from committing the 'overt act' that must eventuate in disunion.
The South will resist by arms' the voice of the majority under the forms of the Constitution,' when that 'voice' calls to power men who have proclaimed the 'irrepressible conflict,' and this 'fight against' the 'vitals' of slavery.
The contest will be no sectional war, but the battle of Conservatives, North and South, against Northern fanatical Destructives. This battle may eventuate in disunion, but the South will stand by the Constitution and the rights it guarantees, and under the confederation, call upon conservatives of every section to rise in arms and put down fanaticism. If conservatism responds, and, rallying to the Constitution, joins hands and arms with the South, fanaticism and Sewardiam will no longer trouble and distract the harmony and prosperity of the Union.
The bold, brave speeches of Iugersoll, Cashing and 0'Connor, Cushing and O'Connor, seconded by Vaux, Everett and Haut, by Tyler, Lincoln and Dix, sustained by the thousands of Philadelphia, Boston, New York and other Northern cities, all attest the fact that the Constitution is respected by vast numbers at the North, that our rights have not been handed over to the mercies of fanaticism, but that we have many, very many, bold and brave friends yet at the North, ready to rally to our rights, and, as they have proclaimed them in speeches, to defend them by acts, as well as protect them by arms.
The speakers at the Philadelphia, Boston and New
<c06>
York meeting, have vindicated the North from the aspersions of those who assail all Northern men. These men have done good service to the cause of the Union, and have merited, and should receive the thanks of every Southern man. If in former life any of those gentlemen have entertained and expressed sentiments different from their last speeches, and they bring forward a change of opinion, let it be <illegible>as evidence of their earnest love for the Union<illegible> and their determination to preserve and <illegible> it. In the name, on behalf of the Democracy of Virginia we thank them one and all, and bid them God speed in their work of reformation.
From the Mobile Tribune.
There seems to be a universal movement down East against the fanatics. What it will result in is yet to be seen. Some of the dealers there in fabrics which are used within the South have already suffered by the absence of the usual 'orders' which they receive from our merchants. These men feel that the indulgence of sectional prejudices is costly; and they are beginning to swell the outcry against fanaticism. Being thus in a way to look into the subject, we shall expect them to become presently as good constitutional men as we of the South. If they put down the knaves and fanatics, we see no reason why the Union may not be durable.
So prosperous are our States, that one year ago there was <illegible> in respect to the North. <illegible> people contented.- There was no new provocation to arouse them to anger. The invasion of Virginia by 'Old Brown' has changed all this.
From the Demopolis (Ala.) Gazette.
Gentlemen, you are too late! If such sentiments as you entertain were held by a majority of the Northern people, the Union might be perpetuated -but you are in a minority, and it is folly to talk of our living together as members of the same Confederacy, when a majority of the North sympathize with efforts to butcher our people by the hands of our slaves. The North hates the South. The South hates the North. They are at this time bitter enemies. Can they continue as members of the same Confederacy? We believe that we can live independent of the North. Our great staples will surround us with commercial friends the most powerful on earth. We cannot live in a union with people who are our bitter enemies. New York City merchants who trade with the South might as well try to dam up the Mississippi river with bullrushes as to stop abolition fanaticism in its onward crusade against slavery.
From the Augusta (Ga.) Constitutionalist.
We have already taken occasion several times, to express our opinion of these Union demonstrations at the great commercial centers of the North. They cannot satisfy or re-assure the South. It does not doubt the devotion of the cities of the North to the Union, which has built them up, and does not want any declaration of that devotion. What it does want is action, by the organized conservatism of the North, at the polls, which shall reform its politics, and place in the councils of the nation representatives who will assert and maintain its constitutional rights. The great Union meeting of New York may prove to be a movement in that direction; otherwise it will prove to be a worthless demonstration, so far as the South is concerned in it.
From the New Orleans Courier.
The North must be told, and must honestly endeavor, at least, to comprehend the plain truth in this matter. She must reform altogether the policy which she has been following towards us for many years past, and particularly for the last five years. She must give us evidence that the sentiment proclaimed at Philadelphia, Boston and New York, is shared by the rural population throughout her borders. Will the North, can the North accomplish this? Let us wait with all our remaining patience before taking our final and irrevocable resolve; and find out whether the Northern people really love the white man more, and the negro less, than now appears to be the case.
From the Montgomery (Ala.)Confederation.
It is with no little satisfaction that we have witnessed of late some evidences of a reaction and return to a wholesome state of public sentiment at the North. May we not hope that the fanaticism upon the subject of slavery, like every other <illegible> that has heretofore existed in the world, may have its zenith and its nadir? It never yet has succeeded in controlling the action of a great people for any considerable length of time, and its decline has always been more rapid than its rise. We may be inspired, too, by the hope that those who have been active in giving it birth and growth and strength, have at last seen the deformity and monstrosity of their own progeny, and have been the first in denouncing it. This is a thought worthy of consideration by the philosophical statesman. Is this crusade against slavery at the North purely a fanatical feeling? If so, can it permanently govern even the free States?
from the sevannah Republican.
The vast Union meetings in the principal cities give token of a healthy feeling, and we believe that the ballot-box will furnish convincing proof of the sincerity of their intentions.
From the Richmond Whig.
All that the Southern people ask is to be let alone -and that, certainly, is not agitation. The North has not only trampled upon our Constitutional rights, but a body of men have invaded Southern soil, armed and equipped with a thousand spears, to be put into the hands of a servile race, to cut the throats of men, women and children. Southern men-citizens of Virginia- the State that gave birth to Washington-have been dragged from their beds and murdered like dogs on the road-side, and when we complain of these wrongs and outrages, we are called A-g-i-t-a-t-o-r-s! Pray, what are we agitating? Why, simply, whether or not we had better submit or contend for our Constitutional rights-whether we had better give up all as lost or contend for honor. The South cannot yield-the North can. In the North slavery is but an abstract question, whilst in the South it is a practical one.
From the New York News, Dec. 24th.
There can be no agreement arrived at. Free soilers are not to be trusted. The South cannot sit in Convention with them. Nor will the people's delegation from this State sit in Convention with them. If any section of the party or the delegates from other States shall be so far lost to the great cause of constitutional conservatism as to desire a recognition of the bogus Free Soil delegation, those delegates must lock somewhere else for votes to elect their candidates than to New York. We shall openly <illegible> not only the infidelity, but the doings of anybody so lost to the dictates of common political honesty. We would rather have an open Black <illegible>and let the Union slide,' than to have a <illegible> one, half Abolition, and the rest railroad, nigger and plunder.
NO UNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS.
The United States Constitution is 'a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell.'
The free States are the guardians and essential supports of slavery We are the jailers and constables of the institution. There is some excuse for communities, when, under a generous impulse. they espouse the cause of the oppressed in other States, and by force restore their rights; but they are without excuse in aiding other States in binding on men an <illegible>yoke. On this subject, OUR FATHERS, IN FRAMING THE CONSTITUTION, SWERVED FROM THE RIGHT. We their children, at the end of half a century, see the path of duty more clearly than they, and must walk in it. To this point the public mind has long been tending, and the time has come for looking at it fully, dispassionately, and with manly and Christian resolution No blessing of the Union can be a compensation for taking part in the enslaving of our fellow-creatures; nor ought this bond to be perpetuated, if experience shall demonstrate that it can only continue through our participation in wrong doing. To this conviction the free States are tending.'

From {he Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch
THE EXODUS.
The city police have been relieved of a constant source of solicitude. All the disorderly Southern students, who have given so much trouble to the municipal authorities already daring the season, have patriotically resolved to leave the city for the city's good, and will now inflict upon the Buffering South their riot, drunkenness and folly. The decent, orderly majority of medical students, who have too much sense ' to cat off their noses to spite their faces,' remain, and will go through the term with credit to themselves, receiving those advantages which tuition in the medical metropolis of the Union can only secure. The seceders have in the last act of their folly inflicted an injury upon many poor boarding-house keepers and tailors, to whom they owe large bills; and it is possible they will make it a test of their patriotism that they shall never pay a debt owing to any Northerner. The parties that have incited this exodus are ' professors ' in badly-organized ' one-horse' colleges in Virginia, South Carolina and Tennessee, and other States, which institutions' never could command the confidence of the people of the neighborhoods where they are located. The cause of this stampede is because the people of this city permit the exercise of the right of speech, according to the Constitution of Pennsylvania, and will not consent that persons who bold opinions different from those of the great majority shall be prevented from saying whatever they think, by threats of personal violence or the use of vitriol. The rash course taken by these misguided young students will have its effect upon their whole lives. Either they will come sneaking back to Philadephia before the next annual Commencement, or they will remain to study their profession, under every difficulty and disadvantage, in seminaries that are without apparatus, clinical advantages, or scientific teachers. The result will be that, long after the memory of the temporary and unnecessary excitement which exists at present among a few people shall have passed away, the medical patriots will struggle with the disadvantages of an imperfect medical education, feeling the sober truth, that in consequence of their rashness, want of proper judgment, and that tolerance of opinion which every true American should show to his fellow-citizens, they have made themselves quacks instead of scientific physicians.
The following jeu d�esprit is from the New York Evening Post:-
CHARGE OF THE MEDICAL LIGHTHEADED BRIGADE.
[THREE TEARS AFTER TENNYSON.]
Right from the jaws of Death
Rushed the mad section-ists-
Wretched dissectionists,
All out of breath. 
Letting the fee go, down to the depot
Rushed they-three hundred!
Medical sawbones all-
Heedless of jawbones all-
Thinking of rawbones all! 
�Curse the North!' was their cry-
Theirs not to reason why,
But like young colts to shie, 
Lest the grim ghost of Brown 
Tumble the Union 
Oh, funny three hundred!
Duns to the right of them,
Urging the flight of them! 
Landlords to left of them, 
Laundresses 'reft of them,
Debit-ties sundered! 
Warrants pursuing them, 
Sheriffs undoing them- 
Thus rushed the secessionists, 
Rabid processionists-
Funny three hundred; 
Grinned the Professor's phiz; 
Pupils sole loss it is; 
Paid was the entrance fee, 
No more their gold they'd see,
Would the three hundred. 
Disunion in college, 
Confusion of knowledge, 
Misusion of porridge 
Was well for a forage,
Had fathers not wondered!
Flashed the parental damns: 
Senatorial telegrams 
(Hinting at youthful shams)
From Washington thundered! 
Yet since Osawatomie 
Northern phlebotomy 
Lures like �jack-o'-lights,'
Over the border bogs! 
So the pill Jacobites 
Physicked the Quaker dogs-
Doses-three hundred!
Why hare we wondered 
That thus they blundered? 
Three hundred burning 
For Southern learning, 
Thinking that black-letter 
Was better, far better, 
Than free press and speech 
Which Northern Professors teach.
So the train thundered! 
North keeps the rich fund- 
They go to Richmond,
M. D.-less three hundred.  HaNs.
THE LATE SESSION OP THE MASSACHUSETTS LEGISLATURE-MUSIC HALL.
Boston Correspondence of the Anti-Slavery Standard.
We are glad to say that our disgraceful Legislature must die a natural death this week. It clings to life with the desperation of men who doubt very very much whether there will ever be any political resurrection for them. They seem to have been trying to out-do in truckling, toad-eating and meanness generally the worst of the beggars'-parliaments Gov. Gardner contrived to conjure out of the back slums of politics As if their subjecting their old mother, Massachusetts, to the insult of having Daniel Webster's brassy visage perked perpetually in her face were not humiliation enough, they have lately voted an appropriation of $3,000, to pay the expenses of its Inauguration. And this, although the Statue was offered and accepted on the express condition, that it was to cost the State nothing at all 1 Of course, it is a mere piece of servility and subserviency to curry favor with the wealthy Boston gentlemen who make up the Statue Committee. It could not have been asked for, as the Committee have on hand more than twice that amount of unexpended moneys. And I hope it will be treated with the contempt it deserves by them. Those Hunker gentlemen have at least the credit of pecuniary liberality, and, as it would cost them nothing in this case, one would think they would prefer to keep their word than to break it, only it would have the effect of making Massachusetts pay tribute in money, as well as in soil, to the man she despises the most of all her dead. I trust, for the credit of Boston hunkerdom, that this dirty money will be tossed back in the faces of the dirty fellows that proffer it. I believe I told you how they have been protracting the extra session for the purpose of getting the extra pay they had voted themselves for their worthless services. I say worthless, for the Speaker of the House, through his paper, The Daily Advertiser, stated, a week or to ago, that the whole Statue Revision business was a failure. And the latest of their attempts on the public purse has been to propose to vote an appropriation to pay for some of their clothes that bad been stolen during the session! But, as those losses fell only on a small minority, the majority did master virtue enough to vote it down. The new Legislature assembles next week, and I am happy to be assured that very few of these shabby fellows have been re-elected to it.
This year again, to the grief of all truly conservative hearts, the Fraternity Lectures, organized by Mr. Theodore Parker's Society, have been the most successful of the season. It is truly painful that an Association that has no more sense of propriety than to ask women, negroes, and Garrisonian Abolitionists to speak before it, should be the only one in this Literary Emporium that meets* with brilliant pecuniary success. They not only had Garrisonian Abolitionists to speak before them, bat the very old Garrison himself that made them such. He had a large audience, and uttered much distressing heresy and treason in their ears, and, I grieve to say, without any adequate rebuke. The success of this scheme of lectures has been so great that its promoters gave a supplementary one on the evening of Forefathers' Day, which was delivered by the Rev. Wm. R. Alger, a gentleman who gave serious and just offence, a year or two ago, by his girds at the Complimentary Flnckeyism of Mr. Winthrop. Of course, I could not be expected to attend on the Discourse of a person of such antecedents, and I-found the next morning, from the comments of the Boston Pott, (fan which I derive my opinions
<c02>
generally,) that it was as bad as could possibly be expected. The Sunday services of Mr. Parker's Society, in the Music Hall, are kept up still, and you will be surprised to hear that they are attended by crowded audiences when I tell you that they are performed by such persons as Mr. Wendell Phillips, Mr. Emerson, Mr. Garrison, and the like. When the preached word could be had from Dr. Nehemiah Adams and Dr. Orville Dewey, what are we to think of a community that can flock to Bach ministrations?-D. Y.

A FIENDISH OUTRAGE. 
A paragraph has recently been published, derived from South Carolina papers, stating that a workman engaged on the State House, in Columbia, S. C, was recently seized by a mob, on account, as was alleged, of holding anti-slavery opinions, and that he received thirty-nine lashes, and was tarred and feathered, and then conveyed to Charleston. The following detailed narrative of the injuries inflicted upon the man, is published in the New York Independent. A more inhuman deed is seldom perpetrated. The Independent says:
We have seen this unfortunate man, and heard his story, and looked at his wounds. His name is James tower. He is an intelligent young man, about twenty-three years of age, a native of Wex-ford, Ireland, and a stone-cutter by trade. He went from Philadelphia to the South, and obtained employment in Columbia, where he had worked for nine months.
The only opinion he ever expressed against slavery was that it caused a white laborer in the South to be looked upon as an inferior and degraded man. But this was enough. The remark was reported to the Vigilance Committee, (composed of twelve members,) who immediately ordered the police to arrest him. He was seized two miles away from town, in attempting to escape. He was brought back and put in a cell, where he remained for three days, during which time he was denied the use of pen and ink, and all communication with his friends outside.
At length he was taken before the Mayor. Four persons appeared, and bore testimony to the remark which he had made. The evidence was conclusive. He was returned to prison, and kept locked up for six days. During this time he was allowed only two scanty meals a day, and the food was carried to him by a negro. He was then taken out of jail in the custody of two marshals, who said to him:
'You are so fond of niggers, that we are going to give you a nigger escort.'
He was led through the main street amid a great crowd, hooting and yelling, the marshals compelling two negroes to drag him through the puddles and muddy places of the street, and of the State House yard! As he was taken past the State House, three members of the Legislature, including the Speaker, stood looking on and laughing! The crowd gradually increased until it numbered several thousand persons, headed by a troop of horse.
After a march of three miles out of the city, to a place called the 'Junction,' the procession was stopped, and preparations were made for punishment, The populace cried 'brand him!' 'burn him!' 'spike him to death! 'and made threats against his life by pointing pistols at his head, and flourishing sticks in his face.
The Vigilance Committee ordered him to strip himself naked, and forced a negro to assist in taking off the clothes. A cowhide was then put into the negro's hands, who was ordered to lay on thirty-nine lashes, and to draw blood with every stroke. Our informant describes the pain of this infliction as exceeding in severity anything which he ever suffered before. His back and lower limbs are still covered with the scars of the wounds!
A bucket of tar was then brought, and two negroes were ordered to rub it upon his Weeding skin, and to cover him from head to waist. His hair and eye-brows were clotted with tar. After this part of the ceremony was concluded, he was covered with feathers. His pantaloons were then drawn up to his waist, hut he was not allowed to put on his shirt or coat. He was conducted in this exposed condition, amid the shouts of the populace, to a railroad train, and was put on board the negroes' car. The engineer blew a continuous blast on his whistle to signalize the performance.
A citizen of Charleston on the train, who saw the poor fellow's unhappy condition, stepped into a neighboring hotel, before the starting of the cars, and brought a cup of coffee and some biscuits to relieve the sufferer's faintness. It was a timely gift, and gratefully received. But the Southern chivalry gathered around the Southern gentleman, and threatened him with summary vengeance if he repeated his generosity. The exasperated crowd detained the train, and called for more tar and feathers, for a further infliction upon their bleeding victim. More tar was brought, but more feathers could not be found; and after fresh tar was applied, cotton was stuck upon it instead!
When the train started for Charleston, the mob bade him good bye, and told him that when he reached this city, he would receive one hundred and thirty lashes! At every station between Columbia and Charleston, the engineer blew a prolonged whistle, and gathered a mob to add fresh results to the wounded man. At length, on arriving, he was met by the police, conveyed to prison, and detained in his cell for an entire week. Here he received, for the first time, soap and water to wash off the tar, and oil to soften his sores. A mob several times threatened to break into the prison to carry him out into the street, and make a public spectacle of him a second time; but he was kept closely confined. A physician called to see him to examine his wounds, who told him that his case was a mild one, comparing it with that of a man who was then lying in the City Hospital from the effects of five hundred lashes, which had almost put an end to his life!
On Saturday morning last, at seven o'clock, the poor workman was taken from prison, and conducted quietly on board the steamer for New York. He arrived in this city on Monday last, where he is still staying, recovering from the effects of his ill-treatment, and looking for work, which we hope he may find.
This man informed us that, in common with the great mass of Irishmen in this country, he had always voted with the Democratic party.

From the New York Evening Post.
A CLERGYMAN IN JAIL FOB FIDELITY
TO CHRIST AND) HUMANITY.
The case of the Rev. Daniel Worth, of North Carolina, has awakened much interest in these parts. He is a Wesleyan Methodist, a man of magnificent presence, and of great reputation for eloquence as a preacher. His crime, as reported in the accounts sent us by Southern authority, consists in having said that he 'would not have John Brown hung for a thousand worlds.'
This is an indication of the humanity of his disposition, at least-perhaps, also, of his sagacity in perceiving what was the real policy of the South. There is no doubt that the South would have placed itself in a much more advantageous position than it now occupies, if it bad not taken John Brown's life.
But for this expression of his kindness and good sense, Mr. Worth is persecuted, and unless he is treated with greater lenity than other citizens of his State, will be obliged to leave North Carolina, and seek refuge at the North.
Below we publish a letter from him, furnished to us by the gentleman in this city to whom it was addressed. It gives no indication of flinching under the persecutions of which he is the object:
GREENSBORO' Jail, Dec. 26,1859 I have been three days incarcerated in this jail on charge of a breach of the criminal laws of this State, in preaching and selling incendiary books, Helper's Impending Crisis, &c. The excitement on my preliminary trial was great. I plead my own cause, but three lawyers were against me. My bonds were fixed at ten thousand dollars, a very modest sum in which to bind a preacher. My securities will file my bonds this afternoon, when I shall again have temporary liberty. My trial will come on in April, and though conscious of no offence against any just law, not even against the laws of North Carolina, in consequence of the great prejudice added to the tremendous excitement, I can hardly hope to escape. The punishment, if convicted, is pillory, whipping and imprisonment. Yesterday, the anniversary of the Saviour's Advent, I spent in my prison in reading my Bible and prayer. I seemed to hear my Saviour's voice asking, 'Art thou ready to suffer for ray sake? Const thou enter into dungeons for thy Saviour's love, and suffer shame for my sake? ' When I came to the point, and could say, ' Yes, Lord, I am willing to suffer thy righteous will in all things,' he poured his love into my tool to boundlessly that I shouted aloud for joy. And let me say that I fully believe if I am
<c03>
sentenced to confinement or other punishment, God will glorify his name by my suffering for him as much as though I was at liberty, and working in his vineyard. O let me have the prayers of my dear Christian brethren everywhere, that my faith fail not, and that I may in patience possess my soul! 
Yours, in the love of that Saviour who suffered shame for us, D. WORTH.
ARREST OF THE REV DANIEL WORTH.-The Rev. Daniel Worth was arrested in Guilford on Friday, on Justices' warrant, and was tried before three Justices in Greensborough on Saturday. Messrs. McLean, Dick, and Scott appeared for the State, and Worth spoke in his own defence. We understand that he endeavored to defend his incendiary conduct, and in so doing read extensively from Helper's book. Some fifteen or sixteen witnesses were examined. It was proved that he had used in his sermons the strongest and vilest incendiary language, and had circulated Helper's book. Among other things, he has declared publicly that he has 'no respect for the laws of North Carolina;� that 'they were enacted by adulterers, drunkards, and gamblers;' and that he 'would not have had Old John Brown hung for a thousand worlds' He was held to bail in the sum of $5,000 for his appearance at Court, and $5,000 for his good behavior. He had given bail for his appearance, and was endeavoring to give bail for his good behavior. The Sheriff of Alamance, Mr. Patterson, was present, and intended to arrest him on a writ issued by Judge Saunders, as soon as he passed from the jurisdiction of the Justices' Court. He may, therefore, be expected hero this evening, to an ewer before Judge S. for his violation of the law in Alamance, Chatham, and Randolph.
We learn that the excitement in Greensborough was very great, and that the officers of the law experienced difficulty in protecting Worth from the indignation of the people.-Raleigh Standard.

ANOTHER SHOCKING CASE.
GLASTENBURY, Conn., Dec. 28, 1859. 
The Rev. Mr. Alberton was brought to his home -three miles from here-last Friday, with one leg broken and his head and arm bruised, by a fall from the cars, on his way home from Alabama, where he went a few weeks since, in the employ of Mr. Stebbins of Hartford, peddling books. He was arrested after the John Brown invasion, on suspicion of evil designs, and imprisoned twelve days. The suspicion was founded on a passage found in a letter of another person, in the same business, from Mr. Stebbins. The suspicious sentence was this:' Take the best men, be faithful, do your work thoroughly; my agent in this section is the Rev. Mr. Alberton, whose head quarters is at' I don't recollect the name of the place. On this expression they founded a suspicion of treason, and sent forthwith to the place and arrested Mr. A., and the mob gathered around and cried out, 'Shoot him, shoot him!' 'hang him, hung him!'. He was searched, tried, and false charges were brought against him, and he was thrust into prison. He was so excited that he finally had turns of derangement.'
His case being reported to Mr. Stebbins, he procured testimony of names in Hartford, as Gov. Seymour and others, who could be trusted, and was released, and paid $60 for false imprisonment. He was put on board of a steamer On the Alabama River to Montgomery, and thence by cars came home. In a fit of derangement he jnmped out of the cars this side of New Haven, and lay from 6 P. M., Thursday, to 3 A. M., Friday, when he was found, and accompanied to Hartford.
I saw him on Monday of this week. He is very feeble, and lies prostrate, bruised and mangled, like the ' man who went from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves.' He is unable to talk much yet, he is so exhausted and excited. He has a family consisting of a wife and six children; is an Englishman by birth; has preached in this part of the town five years, and has preached in' this country about ten years. He owns a house in Manchester, and suspends preaching on account of the inconvenience of moving about with a family of small children. He is a whole-souled, large-hearted Englishman and Christian; a man of unblemished moral character, and in good standing. He spent last winter in North Carolina, and preached at times on the Sabbath in his own and all other denominations.
Yours, F. SNOW.
Dr. Mulroe, of S. C, the owner of two plantations, and negroes sufficient to work them, was arrested a few days ago, as a suspicious character, by a vigilance committee, in Eufala, Ala. The doctor was peddling ploughs, and it was hard to believe that so wealthy a man would turn ' traveling Yankee.' A friend, who knew the Doctor at home, happened to be in town, however, and heating of the difficulty he was in, went to the place where the committee were trying him, and when he entered and found Dr. M., occupying a chair, and undergoing an examination, under such peculiar circumstances, he was so astonished that he exclaimed, 'Why, Dr. Mulroe,' and burst out in a loud laugh, while the doctor, overcome with his feelings, burst into tears, and the sympathy was so intense that the whole committee were soon in tears! As a finale, all pledged themselves to sell as many ploughs as they could.

THE LIBERATOR 
BOSTON, JANUARY 6, 1860.
REMEMBER THE TEEMS.
To our Subscribers. Those of our subscribers who have not paid for the current year,-that is, from January 1st, 1859, to January 1st, 1860,-are reminded of the standing rule by which their papers will be discontinued after February 1st, 1860, unless payment for the same be previously sent in.
The Financial Committee, in calling attention to the above standing rule, would also ask every subscriber, for the sake of the cause, as well as for the sake of the paper, to do what in him lies to extend the circulation of the Liberator, at least to the extent of procuring each one an additional name for our list.

OUR THIRTIETH VOLUME. We cordially proffer to our subscribers and readers the salutations of the New Year. With this number we commence the thirtieth volume of the Liberator. It has been a long, desperate, eventful, ' irrepressible conflict' with the most ferocious and Satanic system of despotism now existing on earth; but, though the end is not yet, surely it cannot be far distant-for the 'battle waxes to the gate,' and all the signs of the times are indicating that a great revolution is at hand. Let there be a fresh consecration of means and efforts to secure a splendid triumph for freedom, and thereby to give peace and prosperity to our country.
We have asserted, on another occasion, that, morally speaking, the South is one vast Bedlam on the subject of slavery, and the slaveholders lunatics. In demonstration of the truthfulness of this charge, read Gov. Wise's harangue to the squad of medical students who recently left Philadelphia in great dudgeon because freedom of speech was protected by the city authorities, and whose presence has always been a curse and a poisonous contagion to that city. Did Bedlam ever exhibit any thing more ludicrous or more incoherent? Such a person as Gov. Wise, in Massachusetts, would be deemed a fit candidate for the asylum at Worcester.
We lay before our readers yet another discourse on the Virginia tragedy, which will be found worthy of a thorough perusal. It is by Rev. IT. M. Fisk, (of the Universalist denomination,) of Taunton, who though located where the Anti-Slavery cause is far from being popular, allows no occasion to pass unimproved to record his testimony against the colossal iniquity of our land, in earnest and eloquent language.
The First Independent Baptist Female Society celebrated its 21st anniversary on the evening of December 22d, at the Joy Street Church in this city The exercises consisted, in part, of addresses by Miss Nancy Weaver, Miss Hannah Miller, Rev. J. Sells Martin, John T. Hilton, and Wm. Wells Brown, and the presentation of on elegant Bible to William C Nell, in behalf of the society, by the President, Mrs. Rhoula Jones.

THE TWENTY-SIXTH 
NATIONAL ANTI SLAVERY
SUBSCRIPTION
The Anti-Slavery families who bare so long made Boston the seat of this annual social occasion, gratefully renew their invitation to all the early friends of Freedom, and cordially extend it to the multitudes of new friends in every part of the land, whom the past year has made; earnestly entreating the satisfaction of their company at
THE MUSIC HALL,
BOSTON,
On Wednesday, January 25th. Soiree at 7 o'clock. 
The general arrangements for the day and evening the same as last year.
We, who now unite in this heartfelt invitation, are not of Northern origin exclusively; some are of the South, an8 some have been slaveholders. But all seeing clearly that the present must be a year of unwonted moral exertion, if our country is to be carried successfully through the present hopeful crisis, unite in entreating our friends to meet us in this way at its opening, for mutual understanding and co-operation., counsel and encouragement, sympathy and congratulation. Never were the signs of the peaceful extinction of slavery so full and propitious to the eyes long trained to read them aright.
We shall shortly Bend special invitations to both the carter and later friends. In the mean time, we entreat all who love their native land, and are beginning to feel deeply moved, to serve and save it, to consider the necessity of steady, long-sustained, unremitting exertion, 'such as we carry on, and to uphold it now by presence, if possible-at all events by letter and by sympathy. The names of such as have reasons for avoiding publicity will be sacredly kept, and our grateful expressions conveyed to them by private acknowledgment.
Let none who sympathize with us be absent because our special invitation may fail to reach them, for accident and omission, however carefully guarded against, are almost unavoidable in issuing invitations on so large a scale: and the occasion is one that will, we trust, bring to our acquaintance many now unknown, to us, whose co-operation will be most valuable.
We entreat any whose love of the cause induces them to hesitate about making what they account a small Subscription, to remember that while the largest sum is small in comparison with the grandeur of the Cause, the smallest may be the expression of high feeling, high thinking, and self-sacrifice.

THE PETITION FOR PROHIBITING SLAVE-
HUNTING in Massachusetts.
Friends! the time is short, and the work of securing names to the petition should be taken up and completed without loss of time. Do not let the work be thrown entirely on one or two persons in any place. In every town let a committee, of men and women, representing all parts of the town, be selected, who will see that the petition is presented at every horns. By this division of labor, the work will be easily and speedily done. It needs only this effort to secure, we believe, the names of five-sixths of the men and women of Massachusetts to the petition. Many hearts and hands are now at work for this object throughout the North. Let Massachusetts not be found wanting.
Give the petition to your representative in the Legislature; or, if preferred, send it to the care of Samuel May, Jr., 21 Cornhill, Boston.
To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts:
 The undersigned, citizens of
Massachusetts, respectfully ask you to put an end to SLAVE-HUNTING, in Massachusetts, by enacting that no person who has been held as a Slave shall be delivered up, by any officer or court, State or Federal, within this Commonwealth; to any one claiming him on the ground that he owes ' service or labor' to such claimant, by the laws of one of the Slave States of this Union.

GOOD AUTHORITY.
It is always satisfactory to know the decision of the highest authority, the very most competent judge in each particular department. Here are a few recent decisions.
Colonel Charles G. Greene, Editor of the Boston Post, vouches for the correctness of Rev. George H. Hepworth's view of 'True Christianity.' (See Post of Dec. 31st.)-There is one thing settled.
�Doctor' J. C. Ayer (the cherry-pectoralist of Lowell) vouches for the statement of another Doctor -his personal friend-that the abolition of slavery has been an unmitigated curse to the negro race in � Dem-arara, Saint Domingo, Hayti, and Trinidad.'-There is another matter settled. (See Proceedings of the Union-saving Meeting in Lowell.)
Rev. South-side Adams of Boston (having been selected by several other clergymen to perform that function) has made a careful' examination' of Rev. Henry E. Dwight, in Randolph, Mass., and vouches for him as perfectly,competent to teach Christianity in the First Congregational Church in that place.-There is a third thing settled.
Lastly, President James Buchanan, after assuming � that we have enjoyed the special protection of Divine Providence ever since our origin as a nation'-and that we have deserved that care by being � a Christian and moral nation' (!!)-tells us that � It is a striking proof of the sense of justice which is inherent in our people, that the property in slaves has never been disturbed, to my knowledge, in any of the Territories'! -and proceeds to declare that this reign of justice, thus providentially existing in fact, has 'been irrevocably fixed, by the final decision of the Supreme Court' I (See the late 'Message.')-Here is a whole group of things settled.
It may be added that coffee is irrevocably settled by fish-skin, if all subsequent 'agitation' is avoided.- C. K. W.
The new Legislature of Massachusetts con-vened in Boston on Wednesday. Hon. Charles A. Phelps was. chosen President of the Senate, and John A. Goodwin, Eaq. of Lowell, Speaker of the House.

CHURCH - CRAFT IN DEFENCE OF CASTE.
 Dear MR. GARRISON:
It seems to <illegible> that the accompanying article from the Congregations <illegible>, with the rejected paragraph inserted in brackets <illegible> its proper place, and the connected facts which lend you herewith, may well be put on record, in <illegible> of the unfair means customarily used by those clergymen who manage the 'religious' press, both keep up the reputation of their own theological <illegible> and to prevent the spread of such truth (anti-slavery and other) as would damage that reputatid,
1. The clergy of Boston <illegible> accustomed to recognize Park street and Rowe <illegible> churches as Christian, in spite of their keeping <illegible>by church-law and church-custom a system of castle which in India they all protest against as one of the worst elements of heathenism.
2. Finding an assumption of <illegible> character for the 'respectable white' church <illegible> Rowe street made by the editor of the Congregationalist, (just after he had noticed and remarked upon the impeachment of that church, for that reason, <illegible>English newspapers,) I wrote the article above mentioned, sailing his attention to the support of <illegible> by that church, and requesting his opinion of its compatibility with Christianity.  
With an approach towards justice unusual <illegible> class, the editor inserted most of my article, (all, in deed, except a paragraph exposing the guilt of clerical brother,) but declined to reply to question which convicted himself of unfaithfulness.
3. Wishing the people of Rowe street church to be informed of the charge thus made against them, took the Congregationalist to Rev. Mr. Olmstea editor of the (Baptist) Christian Watchman and R flector, and requested him to copy the article in question. He refused. I asked why ? and the following dialogue ensued:-
Editor.-I don't believe it.
 Myself.-I myself carefully copied it from one the pew-deeds.
Editor.-It is obsolete.
Myself.-The deed from which I copied it is <illegible> under which a member of the church now holds <illegible> pew, and every pew-deed makes the same provision Look at them for yourself.
Editor.-I know Dr. Stow to be an anti-slavery man.
Myself.-Then he will be pleased with the publication of this fact. Why not insert it 1
Editor.-No. I have great respect for Dr. Stow, <illegible> regard for his church.
And thus ended our conference.
 Our English friends find it hard to believe that the converts of the late ' glorious revival' in Park street and Rowe street churches, and the ministers <illegible> made those converts, treat the colored people, eye those whom they acknowledge to be Christians, <illegible> stantially as a Brahmin treats a Sudra. It is by<illegible> publication of facts like the above that they must 1 prepared to meet and refute such false statements have been made to them by Rev. Dr. Pomroy are Rev. Dr. Stow. Only by reading, marking, learning and inwardly digesting facts like these, can British Christians understand the extent to which religion and morality are perverted in our American churches under the influence of fraternization with slaveholders and their clerical abettors-c. K. w.

IS CASTE ' EVANGELICAL'? To the Editor of the Congregationalist.
DEAR SIR :Before coming to the main subject this article, allow me to present to you the correction of an erroneous assumption in the Congregationalist which I hope you will be willing to give to its readers.
In an editorial article (Dec. 2d) headed ' The Atlantic Monthly,' you ' assume, in advance,' that a article containing your religious ideas 'would be denied admission ' to that Magazine.
The exclusiveness here assumed to belong to the Atlantic Monthly, was unscrupulously stated as a <illegible> in the October number of The Congregational Quarterly, in a critical notice which called that publication � a Magazine professedly non-committal on theological differences, and closed against alt articles of Ortho dox ring and odor.' (P. 410.)
I showed this assertion to the editor of the Atlantic Monthly, for the purpose of inquiring whether it was true. He indignantly declared it to be utterly false affirming that no article had ever been refused on ac count of the characteristic in question, and also that such characteristic would neither occasion, nor eve tend towards, the exclusion of such an article.
Your article, above named, speaks of your having entertained the hope that the ' tone ' of the Atlantic would be modified, on its going into the hands of new publishing firm, 'one of whom is a prominent member of an evangelical denomination.'
Presuming that the connection here spoken of a ' evangelical' is the membership of one of this firm in the Rowe Street Baptist Church, under the pastoral care of Rev. Dr. Baron Stow, I would respectfully in quire whether you and your readers are aware that the ownership of pews in that church is carefully restricted, by the terms of the pew-deed, to 'respectable white persons' ?
So serious an imputation upon a church calling it self Christian, as the persistent upholding, both in theory and practice, of a system of caste, the same <illegible> kind with that which all Christian missionaries in India are trying to break down, should not be made upon mere hearsay, or without the presentation <illegible> proof. I therefore present to your readers the following extracts, which I have myself carefully copied from the printed deed under which a member of Dr Stow's Church now holds his pew, bearing the signature and seal of the church's present Treasurer.
' KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS,
' That the Rowe Street Baptist Society, a corporation for religious purposes, established in the city of Boston, in consideration of the sum of  dollars, paid by, of, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, do hereby sell and convey unto the said representatives and assigns, the Pew numbered, in the meeting-house of said Society; situate at the corner of Rowe and Bedford Streets, in said city.
� To Have and to Hold the same to the said representatives and assigns, but subject to all By-Laws of said Society, and the following conditions, vis.:
' And it is a further| condition of these presents, that, if the owner or owners of said pew shall determine hereafter to sell the same, it shall first be offered, in writing, to the Standing Committee of said Society..... And if said Committee shall not so complete such purchase within said ten days, then the said pew may be sold by the owner or owners thereof (after payment of all such arrears) to any one RESPECTABLE WHITE PERSON; but upon the same conditions as are contained in this instrument.' (The italics and capitals in the above extracts are mine.)
This document, adopted after discussion, printed, and persistently retained for thirty-five years, by the 'Rowe Street Baptist Society'-in a city and a country where black men are subjected to various contemptuous and oppressive disabilities on account of their color, while, at the same time, that city and country are sending missionaries to break down the institution of caste in India-shows a characteristic of our state of religion and civilization, which would seem to demand strong and earnest comment from the ' religious press.' I, however, will intrude upon your columns only by the following brief suggestions and inquiries.
Within the past fifteen year, some progress has been made in Boston towards the overthrow of this system of caste.
The omnibusses and railroad cars now admit colored people on equal terms with white ones. The Rowe Street Baptist Society still continues its invidious restriction!
The public schools now admit colored children on equal terms with white ones. The Rowe Street Baptist Society still continues its unrighteous restriction!
<c06>
The Public library of Boston admits, colored people to participate in its benefits on equal terms with white ones. The Rowe Street Baptist society with continues its oppressive restriction!
The Boston Museum, an institution which pretends no higher object than the amusement of the people,admits colored men and women to its benefits on equal turns with white ones. The Rowe Street Baptist society still continues its shameful restriction!
The 28th Congregational Society of Boston, <illegible> shipping in the Music Hall, whom you are accustomed unjustly to reproach as 'Deistical' and 'Infidel, have, always, during the thirteen years of their existence, welcomed colored people to their meetings on equal terms with white ones. The Rowe street Baptist Society still continues its unchristian restriction! 
[Finally. during the eleven or twelve years during which the Rev. Dr. Baron Stow has been the <illegible> of the Howe Street Baptist Society, though the re-forms above noticed have been constantly going <illegible> this city around him, he has never made the slightest attempt to displace this invidious, unrighteous, <illegible> give, shameful and unchristian restriction from the theory and practice of the Society in which he assumes to be a minister of the Gospel.
I close by respectfully requesting of you dear sir, an answer to these two questions :-
If a body of converts in Calcutta should form them selves into a church, adopting the creed and covenant of the Rowe Street Baptist Church, and living is nearly in conformity to those documents as the Rowe Street church-members do, with the single exception of maintaining the Hindoo system of castle, IN THEORYand PRACTICE, would you call that an <illegible> church?
In the light of the information I have now given you respecting the theory and practice of Dr. Baron Stow, Rowe Street Church, do you call that an <illegible>
gelical church<
Respectfully,
CHARLES K. WHIPPLIE,
233 Shawmut Avenue.
Boston, Dec.6, 1859.
The perspicacious author of the above ought to know that the term ' Evangelical' is used by us in its ordinary technical sense in this community is distinguishing those who hold, for substance the Trinitarian faith set forth in the 'Assembly's shorter Catechism from those who hold its Unitarian <illegible> He ought, therefore to be able to answer his own questions.
We are free to say, However, that we have no <illegible> ogy to make for the church in quotum, or any <illegible> which makes such an invidious and unchristian distinction.-Ed. CONGREGATIONALIST

AMERICA DISGRACED ABROAD.
LONDON, DEC, 15, <illegible>
MY Dear Sir,-The English newspapers and especially the Morning Star-will have made you acquainted with the infamous treatment to which several ladies and gentlemen of color have recently been subjected by the American Embassy. In Miss <illegible> case, you will find that the gentlemanly Secretary the Legation not only refused to grant her <illegible> but threatened to have her put out of the <illegible> cause she indignantly protested against the injustice with which she was visited' My object in writing is not to make you acquainted with facts,, with which you must already be familiar, but to state some circumstances that occurred after Miss Remond's <illegible> An American gentleman, well known to yourself <illegible> who does not wish to have his name published, <illegible> at the Embassy with a view to obtain \ passport for a lady and gentleman of color, the latter being desires of travelling on the continent for the benefit of <illegible> health, which is in a very precarious state. Our American friend stated that his object was of a <illegible> character. In the first place, he wished to be of <illegible> vice to persons who had substantial claims appoints sympathy and assistance; and then, again, he was anxious, if possible, to save his country from contumely and disgrace. Influenced by these Laudals motives, he applied to the Secretary of the <illegible> for a passport, assuring him, in reply to injuries which he made, that the persons for whom it was wanted were American citizens. But the Secretary. Having the application of Miss Remond <illegible> recollection, required an assurance that they wet white, and not of dark complexion 'This <illegible> our friend was, of course, unable to make, and he the frankly made the Secretary acquainted with: he <illegible> of the case, and with the motives by which he hi been guided. He said that he 'wished to save the credit of his country, and he was therefore willing) take the responsibility of representing that the <illegible> and gentleman for whom he sought to obtain the pa-ports were American citizens. He, of course, co-tended that, as they were citizens of Massachuset. They were also citizens of the United States, and <illegible> entitled to all the courtesies and privileges of 3uci position, the red Scott decision (<illegible> it appears to improperly designated) notwithstanding. But the diplomatic mind could not or was afraid to perceive the force of this logic, most probably the latter, be cause the Secretary confessed that he was acting upon instructions received from his own government. Our friend then endeavored to induce him to write to the French Consul-General, stating the difficulty in which his instructions placed him, and asking that functionary to grant the passports. This suggestion he premised to consider; but, of course, he did not act upon it. In the meanwhile, our friend first wrote, and then went himself to the French Consul, who, when the circumstances were explained, most cheerfully granted a passport, and said, moreover, that he had written or should write to his own government, asking power to deal with this special class of cases, Thus from French Imperialism the colored man obtains <illegible> right* which art insultingly denied to him by Republicans America.
The people of the North ought to know that <illegible> duct, such as this, on the part of their represent<illegible> pours so much contempt and odium on the America name, that, before long, no white statesman will be able to travel in Europe without exposing himself to the perpetual humiliation of being branded as a <illegible> driver. If sympathy for the negro will not induce the people of the North to overthrow the <illegible> government at Washington, surely some regard their own self-respect, and for the reputation of their country in the eyes of other nations, will induce <illegible> to require a change of rulers, and also change of policy. The people of England do not and <illegible> understand the odious prejudice against color, and believe nothing could more tend to diminish those friendly feelings, which, Heaven grant! they may always entertain towards your country, than <illegible> infestation of such a detestable prejudice in their most by those who are, or should be, appointed to <illegible> Americans of every color and race.
If you have received these facts from any of her source, you will, of course, make no use of this letter. Believe me to remain, very truly yours,
F.W.CHESSON.
We have received no other intelligence of this disgraceful affair than what is contained in Mr. son's letter. Of course, we blush for our country.
One of the meanest things yet done - perhaps the meanest thing of all-is the refusal of our Legation in London to vise the passport of Miss Remond, a colored lady of this State, distinguished for character and accomplishments, on the ground that she was not a citizen of the United States. When she remonstrated against this infamous treatment, the Secretary <illegible> gation threatened to have her removed from the house by force! But that it would soil the filthiest boot to place it in contact with his person, the became would deserve to be kicked.-Boston Traveller.
Mrs. Child and Mrs. Mason.(Mrs. Senator Mason, according to a flunkey ism that is coming into use, for she is wife of Senator Mason) have had a passage of pens on the subject of slavery, Mrs. Mason beginning the controversy, and Mrs. Child ending, it, very conclusively, Mrs. Child talks like a woman - rid.

JOHN BROWN MEETING IN IOWA.
CLINTON, (Iowa,) Dec. 11, 1859.
SAMUEL MAY, JR.:
DEAR SIR-On receipt of your John Brown Circular, I renewed my exertions to secure some meetings in this community, to be held on Dec. 2d. in honor of the cause of Liberty, in which the hero of Osawatomic lived and died. In this town, we have the rottenest of the rotten Democracy to contend with, which is so much backed up by the timidity and tender-footedness of Republicanism, that the day passed without any proper observance by the friends of Liberty for scores of miles around us. But Clinton has had two John Brown meetings. The first was held on the eve of the eventful 2d instant, and was presided over by William Wentworth, in his own hall, the free use of which was generously offered A.T. Foss last winter, and which Mr. F. used to good purpose. Mr. W. is an old friend of freedom; and though now a Republican, is exceedingly in advance of that class of politicians. As Secretary of our meeting, I was called on for resolutions, and presented a list,in which it was resolved, 'that it is a day calling for mourning by every friend of liberty'-that 'Brown, however misguided, was a hero, a good man, and worthy of as high a monument as any now reaching the American heavens'-that 'if John Brown is a traitor, so is Wise'- that 'if he was a murderer at Harper's Ferry, then is every man a murderer who fights and kills in defence of liberty'-that 'Brown's invasion, and Wise's threatened revolution in 1856, only indicate the existence of the "irrepressible conflict," which must terminate either in the abolition of slavery or the dissolution of the Union'-that 'the Union is of more service to the South than to the North, and the sooner it is dissolved, the better'-that 'sympathy should be extended to Brown's family'-and that 'hereafter, the second of December should be commemorated.'
These resolutions brought the 'unterrrified' to their feet, and one of them immediately offered a resolution that the aforesaid 'resolutions were highly in surrectionary, and a - humbug.' The object of this movement was obviously to quash the meeting, but failed. In remarks on the resolutions, I had to confess that I was out of the American Union, and that no union really existed between the Free and Slave States-which remark, I have been told, was too much for this community. However, our meeting was adjourned for one week. It was called simply for an expression of different views on the 'justice of Brown's sentence, and its relation to the "irrepressible conflict"'; and, on the second evening, (Dec. 9,) we had all sorts of 'expressions,' from the howling of demons to the eloquence of angles. As our town had never before had a general meeting on the slavery question, and-like most new towns-its people unacquainted with each other's views, it was difficult for the few real friends of the slave to foresee what degree sympathy could be elicited for Brown. But we thought it a capital time to bring out a popular expression of sentiment, and we succeeded. Fortunately, a son of old Dr. Brisbane, (of early Anti-Slavery note,) was present, as was also Hon. E.Graham, of Dewitt, in our county. (Judge G's kindness to Mr. Foss gave him the best meeting he had with us last winter.)Previous to our assembling together, rumors were afloat that the Democracy would be present and control the meeting. They gave us an overflowing house, Mr. Brisbane addressed the meeting, and was followed by our U.S.Commissioner who sent John Brown to hell, and then brought back his spirit from pandemonium, hung it up in the back of the hall, grinned at it sardonically, and was cheered lustily by his low comrades present. I shall attempt no description of his vile words and grimaces and of the demoniacal responses from his fellows, I can only refer you for a parallel to the last scenes of an old Congress, or the opening ones of the new. 
After a struggle, we succeeded in getting Judge Graham on the floor, who came forward as a man and forgot the politician. It was a great relief to the friends of liberty to hear his Honor attempt a little justice with John Brown, and rank him with Cromwell and Washington-and through careful not to justify Brown's invasion, yet credited him with true heroism. He charged home the 'irrepessible conflict.' 'Seward!' interrupted a citizen lawyer 'Southern instructions!' replied the Judge. 'Seward!' again, from the other. 'Slavey!' a dozen times-the Judge approaching the lawyer followed in a serious speech about the seriousness of the question. about the wickedness of Ward Beecher. and the malines of Gov. Wise, etc.
Of course the 'unterrified' voted down, by a small majority, our resolutions of sympathy for Brown, and voted up a few indefinite resolves about the crime of agitation. Early in the meeting, the Postmaster moved to adjourn-but 'brought the house down' against him. It is romored that our Postmaster has family connections back, that were massacred during the West India uprising if the blacks, years ago. Of course he, as a conservative man, dreads agitation. But he should remember that he has come to a Free State, Where agitation is the life of liberty. Of all men he should sympathize with poor Brown, who lost so many of his family by the ferocity of the Slave Power.
Our meeting was a success for liberty. A John Brown meeting has been held in the midst of slaveholders, and others will be held in this community, for miles around.
Yours for free thought and free men, 
C.B.CAMPELL.

JOHN THE LIVING, AND JOHN THE DEPARTED.
John Beeson, the well-known and noble philanthropist and friend of the Indian, has been holding a serious of meeting at Athol and Orange, exciting universal praise by the manly candor and religious fervor of his deportment, and by rugged yet pathetic eloquence of his style.
Last Monday, Mr. Beeson spoke in the large and enthusiastic meeting called in memory of John Brown Rev. Messrs. Norton, Bradburn and Hamilton likewise addressed the meeting, after which, Mr. Hoyt, counsel for John Brown, gave an interesting report of the trial family of the martyr.
At a subsequent meeting, on Wednesday night, John Beeson was more than usual spirit-stirring in the style of his address, and we hope made a lasting impression in behalf of his great and philanthropic project.
D. J. Mandell and G. H. Hoyt and Dr. John Williams were appointed a committee to collect funds, and to call meetings in aid of the cause. 
D. J. MANDELL.
E. H. Heywood delivered a lecture, a last week, before the New Bedford Lyceum, on 'Man, not Clothes.' From the Mercury's notice of it we take of the following:-
The Lecture Committee added a new laurel to their patrons E. H. Heywood, Esq., of Worcester. Those whom the storm detained from the lecture lost a truly unique performance.'
The standard, in an extended report, says, ' An eloquent tribute was paid to Wendell Philips as a man of unequalled eloquence and philosophy, who had thrown reputation, family pride, social esteem, wealth everything away for an idea, which elicited great applause as did the allusions to Sumner, Brown, and several other passages in the lecture.'

POPULAR SENTIMENT. 
ARRIVAL OF SENATOR SEWARD.-Governor Seward reached New York in the Arago Tuesday evening, last week. The weather was bitterly cold, but quite a number of citizens met the Senator at the landing, and more at the Astor House. One hundred guns were fired in the park. At a later hour, Mr. Seward proceeded to the city hall, to receive the greeting of the City Council and other city officials. A dense crowd thronged the hall, and when the distinguished visitor appeared, he was greeted with a tempest of applause. On reaching the Aldermen's room, he was welcomed by Mayor Tiemann in a neat speech, to which he made an appropriate reply. 
UTICA, Dec, 30th.-Senator Seward passed here at noon. An immense crowd met him at the depot. There was much enthusiasm; the bells were rung, salutes fired, and cheering by the people.
SYRACUSE, Dec 30. Senator Seward passed through this city this afternoon on his way to Auburn. He was received by a large and enthusiastic crowd in the depot, and was welcomed by Hon. F. T. Davis in a abort address, to which he responded. The train then passed on amid the shouts of the multitude. 
AUBURN, Dec. 30, 1859.-Gov. Seward arrived home in the 3:20 p.m. train of to-day, and was received at the depot by an immense throng of citizens, the military, the public schools, the clergy, and civil officers. As he made his appearance, he was greeted by the booming of cannon and the deafening cheers of his fellow-citizens of all parties. Michael S. Myers, an eminent lawyer, an old citizen, and the hardest kind of a Hard-Shell Democrat, welcomed him home in an eloquent and appropriate speech, to which the Governor replied in his ever happy manner. He was then escorted to his residence, and greeted at every step with the salutations, and cheerings, and waving of handkerchiefs by the mass of people who blocked the streets, lined the house-tope, crowded the balconies, and occupied every available space. Arches of evergreens, with appropriate mottoes, spanned the street; private and public buildings were decorated with flags and inscriptions; and no means seemed left unemployed to demonstrate the satisfaction felt at his safe arrival home. Among the thousands of mottoes, we noticed the following: 
'Welcome to the defender of the rights of man.' 
'God bless you, Gov. Seward.'
'Welcome to the defender of the liberty of the press.' 
'And the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.'
This last motto was from The Northern Independent (Methodist), one of the boldest and most flat-footed Anti-Slavery papers in the North, edited by Rev. Wm. Hosmer, whose denunciations of Slavery, when editor of The Northern Christian Advocate, brought down upon him the hate of the Pro-Slavery portion of the M. E. Church, and resulted in his ejectment from the editorial management of that paper. 
The following was signed ' The Clergy,' and spanned the gate-way of Gov. Seward's ground: 
'And behold I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places wither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land.'
'The following extract from a speech of Governor Seward was inscribed upon an arch of evergreen, which spanned one of the public streets:
'See to it that freedom and equal rights are inculcated at your firesides, in your schools, and in the churches.'
Everything considered, this was one of the most enthusiastic and hearty welcomes ever extended by a people, without distinction of party, to a public man. It shows that however much they may differ politically, the people of Cayuga County hold in highest esteem the virtues and services of Gov. Seward. 
WITHDRAWAL OF THE SOUTHERN MEDICAL STUDENTS. Referring to this most ridiculous exodus of the Southern medical students from that city, the Philadelphia correspondent of the Tribune says:-
'The cause of this foolish, hasty and ill-advised movement is well known here, and ought to be known everywhere else. These young men have quit our noble medical schools for the sole reason that free speech is allowed in Philadelphia. Their brutal attempt to break up Curtis's lecture by abusing our hospitality and violating our laws, was crushed on the instant by an overpowering police force that detected and publicly exposed them as the actual perpetrators, Their names were paraded in the next morning's Police Reports, and bail was required of them to answer at Court. All this was so different from the plantation law which they had been educated to administer, that it could not be tolerated, and hence the childish stampede of which they will soon be heartily ashamed. We are not sorry at their departure. Their morals have been anything but commendable; their manners low; their language loose and profane, and their associations such that but few of them were ever permitted to enter the doors of a genteel family. 
It is a solemn fact that the indignant Virginia doctors are back again-the very fellows who went off in such a rage only ten days ago! not all of them yet; but they are sneaking back in squads of two, three, and half a dozen at a time, careful to avoid fuss, and seeking to excuse their childish folly by saying they only wanted a holiday frolic. Every mother's son of them will be back to his old haunts before the Winter is over, greatly to the relief of certain tailors and washerwomen, though they employ the former class much more extensively than the latter.'
TRIAL OF STEVENS. Andrew Hunter, District Attorney of Jefferson county, Va., has written a letter to George Sennott, Esq., of this city, informing him that Aaron D. Stevens, the Harper's Ferry insurrectionist, is to be tried sometime during the winter-perhaps during the present month of January-by the Virginia State authorities, as at first proposed. This change in relation to Stevens' trial has probably been made in consequence of the appointment of Senator Mason's Congressional Investigating Committee, who, it has been intimated, will summon Dr. Howe, Wendell Phillips, and other Northern abolitionists before them as witnesses, and it is quite likely that the Virginia State authorities will subpoena the same parties into their dominion if they get a chance.-Boston Journal. 
WON'T TELL.-The Virginia Legislature having inquired of Gov. Wise the cost of suppressing the late invasion at Harper's Ferry, and hanging the prisoners, he answers that the accounts are not all in, and will not be until his term expires; but the expenses will be very large, on account of the disorganized condition of the Virginia militia making it necessary for him to improvise a force for the occasion. A portion of the military guard, he says, will be retained till after the two remaining prisoners, whom he pronounces the worst of the lot, are tried and executed.
NON-INTERCOURSE.-The New York Times relates the following incident to show the practical workings of the non-intercourse policy so much talked about at this time:
A Virginia lady, writing to a gentleman in this city the other day, stated she had resolved to cut off all intercourse with the Abolition North, and rather than patronize Northern trade, she, with other ladies in that section, had. resolved hereafter to dress in home made lindsey woolsey. Two days subsequently, the same gentleman received a letter from the same lady, inclosing a sample of silk, and requesting that a dress pattern of the goods might be purchased and forwarded to her address in the Old Dominion.
GEORGIA.-The Legislature of Georgia has passed a law, making it unlawful hereafter for any itinerant person or persons to vend or sell in that State any article of value, not manufactured in Georgia, by sample or otherwise, without a license. The license is 'one hundred dollars, or other sum at the discretion of the Inferior Court of the County' in which the peddling or sales are made. An additional tax of one per cent, on one hundred dollars sold. The penalty is fine and imprisonment.
A law has also been passed providing that free negroes, wandering or strolling about, or leading an idle, immoral, or profligate course of life, shall be sold into slavery for a period not exceeding two years for the first offence; but upon conviction of a second offence they must be sold into perpetual slavery.
SOUTHERN RETALIATION.-The Providence Journal says that a quantity of friction matches were recently found in a bale of cotton received there. They were in a pine box which was partially broken, so that they could not fail to ignite in passing through the picker. Had they not been accidentally discovered, they might have caused the destruction of one of the most valuable mills in Rhode Island. They were probably placed there intentionally.
RECOVERING.-The Louisville Journal says: The more intelligent of the slave owners of Kentucky now think that the numerous anonymous letters scattered through the South during the last few weeks, purporting to emanate from 'Abolitionists,' and warning people of impending plots and attempts at running off slaves, were written by unscrupulous negro traders with a view of getting up a temporary panic in 'stocks,' by rendering prevalent a feeling of insecurity an negro property among the planters. In other words, it was a 'bear' movement in niggers.

THE BODY OF COPELAND -REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCES.
The fate of the body of John Copeland, one of the Harper's Ferry convicts, is attracting some attention, and the facts shown in connection with it are certainly well calculated to excite remark. A correspondent of the Cleveland Leader, writing from Washington December 19th, says the relatives and friends of John Copeland in Ohio, have made the most earnest efforts to secure his body for Christian burial, but without effect. Gov. Wise was telegraphed by the Mayor of Oberlin, A. N. Beecher, Esq., and received for answer that the body would be delivered by Gen. Taliaferro to any white citizen. Mr. Beecher then telegraphed a gentleman at Washington, asking him whether he would go to Charlestown, and see that the body was placed in charge of the Express Company, or get some one to go. The gentleman replied affirmatively, and at once secured the services of the correspondent of one of the strongest pro-slavery papers in Kentucky. This correspondent, who is a Southerner, and strongly pro-slavery in sentiment, was furnished with the order from the gentleman in question, and also with a letter from the Hon. Mr. Boteler, who represents the Charlestown district, which was furnished at the request of the Hon. H. G. Blake. On his arrival in Charlestown, he was ushered into the presence of Gen. Taliaferro, but on presenting his letters, was pot under arrest and kept for twelve hours, when he was permitted to return to Washington. The next morning, the papers stated that the body of Copeland was, or would be, given to the surgeons. The special correspondent of the Cincinnati Gazette, who was present at the execution of Green and Copeland, says: 'They were allowed to remain in the ground but a few moments, when they were taken up and conveyed to Winchester for dissection.' From this showing, it seems that the very reasonable pledge of Gov. Wise, that the body of Copeland should be surrendered to his friends for burial, was not only disregarded, and their feelings and every sense of humanity outraged, by the open and heartless disposition really made of it; but the ' white man' who went to receive the corpse thus promised, was put under arrest and held for twelve hours, while, in all probability, the medical hyenas were dissecting the body thus wrongfully obtained. It is to be hoped, for the sake of decency, as well as good faith, that this showing may be found to be incorrect.-Toledo Blade.
A funeral sermon on the death of John Copeland and Shields Green was preached in Rev. Mr. Hodges' church, in Williamsburgh, last Sunday. 
'The statement that John Brown,' says the Anti-Slavery Standard, 'while on his way to the scaffold, stooped down and kissed a negro child, has been discredited by some persons as improbable, and by others positively declared to be false. The Charlestown correspondent of the Herald goes so far as to accuse the correspondent of the Tribune of inventing the statement. We deem it proper to state that, while In Philadelphia last week, we saw a letter from a Maryland gentleman, affirming the truth of the story in the most positive terms. The only error in the statement, as it first appeared in the Tribune, was in regard to the place where the incident occurred, which was within the jail, and not outside thereof.'

SYMPATHY FOR JOHN BROWN IN CHATHAM, CANADA WEST.
The sympathy felt for John Brown and his worthy co-laborers, from the time that intelligence was received of the noble stand taken by them in behalf of the slave, has been most intense. Before the 2nd of the month, prayer meetings and consultations were held among the people generally; but from 4 o' clock, A. M. of the fatal day up to a late hour in the evening, every minute seemed to be devoted by the colored citizens to the consideration of the sad event.
Prayer meetings were held in the Princess street Methodist, and 1st Baptist Churches, and men and women seemed drawn out with more than usual spiritual power and fervency.
At ten o'clock, religions exercises were again conducted in the above Methodist church, by Rev. Geo. Brodie who preached the admirable discourse from which we give an extract, and was assisted by Revds. R. Pearce, R. Dizney, and Lowery.
Rev. R. M. Duling preached also to a large audience, in the 1st Baptist Church, and in a manner which aroused the deepest sensibilities of all present.
A mass meeting convened in the Methodist church in the evening, at which time Messrs. J. M. Bell and J. H. Harris delivered eulogiums upon the character of the departed hero.-Provincial Freeman. 
BRACKETT'S BUST OF JOHN BROWN.-Mr. E. A. Brackett hits just completed a bust of Brown, which we saw at his studio on Tuesday. Whatever may be thought by any one of old Osawotomie. no one can look upon this bust without the conviction that he was a man of most remarkable qualities. There is about it an air of majesty, nobility and conscious power, which it would be difficult to find surpassed in the busts of any of the great men of this or any other land. As to the fidelity of the representation, we believe it is acknowledged to be faithful by those who knew Brown best; and Mr. Hoyt, who was his counsel, after seeing it, sent to Mr. Brackett the following note:
BOSTON, Dec. 21, 1859.
E. A. BRACKETT, ESQ.-Dear Sir: I have examined your bust of John Brown with great pleasure. It is due you, and not less those who are not familiar with the face of this immortal friend of humanity, to say your efforts have been marvellously successful. Every feature of his face is ineffaceably daguerreotyped upon my mind. This bust, while it is a true reflection of his external features, admirably displays-whether in that lofty brow, that invincible eye, or that determined lip-his irresistible manhood, in the presence of which men of mean mould cannot help bowing in self-disgust. I hope your disinterested labors will be fully rewarded by the appreciation of the public.
Very truly your friend, 
GEO. H. HOYT. 
EGG-NOG IN CONGRESS.-On Monday in the lower House of Congress-it seems to be very low just now -an honorable member from Virginia, William Smith by name, (sometimes known as 'extra-Billy') made a speech on the 'pro' side of the slavery question, when the following delectable scene took place:- 
'During the speech, some one sent Mr. Smith a tumbler of egg-nog, which he drank, saying, "Merry Christmas to all of you!" [Great laughter.]
Mr. Kilgore inquired whether it was in order for the gentleman to monopolize the drinking of egg-nog, while the rest were doing without it?
Mr. Smith said that was one of the constitutional privileges of his side of the House. [Laughter.]
A Voice-I would like to have some. [Loud ha-ha's all over the House.]
After further remarks, Mr. Smith received another tumbler of egg-nog, which he drank, bowing to the ladies in the galleries, creating much merriment. 
Mr. Burnett rose to inquire whether this was a privilege. [Renewed laughter.]
The Clerk said he would not undertake to decide that point, but would if desired put the question to the House. [Laughter.] 
Mr. Moore, of Kentucky. I move that we adjourn, so that all of us may take some of that kind. [Cries of no, no, no, go on.]' 
Very ' amusing'-very. The great American people will 'laugh consumedly,' perhaps-or perhaps not. Possible the above specimen of pot-house manners may not be thought worth the-how many times eight dollars per day?-which it costs. Nero fiddled while Rome was burning, and Billy Smith drinks egg-nog while saving the Union.
The <illegible> Legislature has unanimously adopted a resolution demanding of the treaty-making power of the general government labors to the end of having inserted in the treaty of 1842 a provision requiring Great Britain to surrender fugitives from our slavery, just as she now surrenders fugitives from our justice! Fancy the ignorance of a body that could entertain so ridiculous a proposition for a single instant-a proposition that even a Southern Convention ought to laugh down while it should be in course of reading! Fancy, too. Lord Palmerston's smile on hearing of the business; and, while you are about it, think of the slashing letter that Lord John Russell, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, would write in reply to the delicate proposition that he should turn nigger-eatcher-in-chief to the slaveocrats of the occident! He has written us one or two letters of that kind already, but they would become as nothing when compared with that he would pen when he should be certain to be backed by the united opinion of the whole civilized world, of which he would be the Secretary in denouncing a proposition that ought to be an insult to the ordinary humanity of the race. This side of Ashantee land, there exists not a government to which such a proposition would not be an insult. One would have hesitated before mentioning it to Nana Sahib, had he succeeded in his endeavors to carve a kingdom for himself out of British India.-Traveller.
The Charleston Mercury of Thursday says that two Abolitionists left town on that day for the North, by steamer. One of them was taken in charge several weeks since, and has been earning his living for a month, by cracking stones for the city, agreeable to sentence imposed by the Mayor. He has acquired his trade, and leaves without a single regret. The other was received from Georgetown, where he had expressed obnoxious sentiments.
<c04>
GREAT FIRE IN NEW YORK.-A destructive fire occurred among the warehouses in Beekman street, last week. Fifteen buildings were consumed, with valuable goods, including the extensive paper warehouse of Cyrus W. Field & Co. The loss is estimated at $800,000, and the insurance will probably cover it. Several firemen were injured by the falling walls, and eight men are reported missing. Another fire occurred in Vesey street, at which, it is reported, three lives were lost. 
COLD WEATHER IN NORTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE.-We learn from Mr. George Little, one of the conductors on the Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad, that the thermometer at Littleton, on Thursday morning (29th) was 36 degrees below zero, and at Franconia 37 degrees below. He brought from Woodsville to Concord, on his train that afternoon, a boy who had his hands, feet and ears badly frozen on Wednesday, while sawing wood in a shed. A man at Littleton froze his feet while busy getting out lumber; and at Hopkinton a man was found frozen to death in the street. 
On the 14th ult., so intense was the cold in London that ice fully two inches in thickness was carted from ponds in the suburban districts; and towards evening, as the tide receded from high water mark, a coating of ice was left on the banks of the Thames. The ornamental waters in the various parks were so much frozen that skating was soon anticipated. The London News, of the 17th, says that thousands of skaters and sliders were on the ice the day before, and that several serious accidents were prevented by the Royal Humane Society, who had pitched their tent near at hand in anticipation that their services would be needed. 
Dr. Howe, of the Perkins Institution for the Blind at South Boston, has been invited to deliver a course of lectures in Kingston, Canada, where he is at present. 
Col. Lewis T. Wigfall, the new Texas Senator, has been concerned in several affairs of honor, one with the late Preston S. Brooks, of South Carolina, in which the latter was wounded. 
The Supreme Court of Ohio has derided that colored children cannot be admitted into the common schools of that State. Shameful! 
The Union meeting in Haverhill on Thursday was a failure. The principal speaker was poor Joseph C. Lovejoy, whose brain was turned by being the brother of Elijah P. Lovejoy-an honor that he little deserved.-Newburyport Herald. 
The brother of Copeland telegraphed to Gov. Wise, asking if he might have his body. The reply was that he might have it if he would send a white man for it. Wise could not spare to insult a negro, even upon such an occasion. 
The bill to enslave all free negroes found in Mississippi on the first of July next, has passed the Lower House of the Legislature of that State, with only five votes against it, and will undoubtedly become a law. The money is to go into the school fund! 
The object of the $50 bequest to the agent of the New England Company, made by John Brown's will, is now understood. Nineteen years ago, he contracted a debt to the Company. It had outlawed three times over. But the old Puritan kept paying upon it from time to time as his poverty enabled him to do, and in the hour of his death diminished the debt by $50 more. 
A boating club in Washington, which numbers twenty-five members, lately requested Lewis Clephane, a member, and one of the signers in aid of Helper's book, to resign. 
A Wheeling paper says that as Governor Wise neglected to appoint a Thanksgiving day, the people should observe the day that he goes out of office as a day of giving thanks. 
Gerrit Smith has so nearly been restored to health, that he has returned to his home at Peterboro'. He will probably go to Europe.
We have received Halifax, N. S., papers of Dec 22. The Halifax Journal says that the loss of life at the entrance of that harbor, in the gale of the previous Wednesday, amounted to thirty-one, the largest number for many years.
On Sunday last, there were 8000 persons, including 2000 women, skating on the Central Park.
Governor Wise said, very touchingly, to the medical students, 'You have come back to a nursing mother.' They needed spanking as well as ' nursing.'
The sale of 'Helper's Crisis' has reached the number of 100,000 copies, and the gratuitous distribution 25,000 more. It is believed that it will reach the full circulation of half a million.
Helper has sent a splendidly bound copy of the unabridged edition of his 'Impending Crisis' to Missouri Clark, with a letter returning that gentleman his sincere thanks for the magnificent advertisement he has bestowed, free of charge, upon his 'incendiary' appeal to the poor whites of the South to vindicate their rights.
The year 1859 will be accounted memorable because of the number of illustrious or noted men who have died in its course, equalling, in this respect, 1832, when Scott, and Goethe, and Cuvier, and Adam Clarke, and Bentham, and Champollion, and Spurzheim, and Charles Carroll, and Crabbe, and young Napoleon, closed their eyes forever on earth and its things. The past year has seen Humboldt, and Hallam, and Irving, and Metternich, and De Quincey, and Robert Stephenson, and Brunel and Broderick, and Choate, and Bond, and Prescott, and Oscar of Sweden, and King Bomba, and Paige, and John Brown, and other personages, join the ' innumerable caravan.' 
Neal Dow had a narrow escape from death at Portland on Wednesday last. While in his steam tannery, says the Argus, walking across one of the rafters, about 16 feet from the floor, he became bewildered by the smoke and steam, and fell. His fall was broken by striking another beam, but he came down upon the top of the boiler, striking a hoe, which penetrated through his garments, inflicting a severe wound upon his body. Close by was a vat for scalding hot water into which he came near falling. He was insensible for some time, but ultimately recovered himself, and expressed his thankfulness that he had received no more serious injury. 
SLAVES LIBERATED.-By the will of the late Lewis Y. Christman, of Warren County, N. C. ten favorite favorite slaves have been liberated, and a sum of $10,000 left to be divided among them when they leave the State. The residue of the property, consisting of about 100 slaves and a very large quantity of land, is willed to D. D. Jones, Esq., proprietor of White Sulphur Springs, Warren county.-Warrenton (N. C.) News. 
PHYSIOLOGICAL LECTURES.-Professors Brown and Burnham are delivering a series of lectures at No. 4 Mercantile Building, to the ladies of Boston, on physiology, pathology, anatomy and medicine. These lectures, which are gratuitous, are given every day at 10 o'clock, A. M., and are illustrated by anatomical preparations, manikins, &c.
Henry Ward Beecher charges that in the American edition of Spurgeon's sermons, his sentiments on slavery, contained in the English editions, have been suppressed. The Independent says-' A friend who has compared the English and American editions assures us that it is true.' 
A telegram in the Nord states that fourteen youths, pupils in the Naval School, having been implicated in the late plot in Turkey, were, without trial, tied up in sacks, with a 30 pound shot at their feet, and quietly thrown into the Bosphorus. Their ages averaged about fifteen. 
The 127th anniversary of the birthday of Benjamin Banneker, the great negro mathematician, was celebrated in a becoming manner by the Philadelphia Banneker Institute a short time since The opening address was delivered by the President of the Institute, Mr. Parker T. Smith. 
In South Easton, Pa., on the 22d inst, an itinerant peddler of the 'Life of John Brown' was treated to a dozen lashes on the back, and ordered out of town! 
The slave owners of Missouri are sending their slaves south as fast as possible; 34 recently left St. Louis on one steamer for Nashville, Tenn. 
The letter of Mr. Fillmore to the recent Union saving meeting of New York was not read in public. It did not serve the purpose of the originators of that demonstration. 
Government has lost a million of dollars, on the mail contracts, through the failure of the House of Representatives to organize. This is all owing to the obstinacy of the democratic minority. 
INDICTED.-The Grand Jury of the United States District Court, at Chicago, has indicted eight citizens of Ottawa, Illinois, under the Fugitive Slave Law, who participated in a rescue. 
There is to be a meeting of the citizens of Salem and the adjoining towns, in aid of the fund now being raised for the relief of the families of Brown and his associates at Harper's Ferry, on Friday evening, 6th inst. It will be addressed by Ralph W. Emerson, Wendell Phillips and James F. Clarks.

Scrofula, or King's Evil, 
is a constitutional disease, a corruption of the blood, by which this fluid becomes vitiated, weak, and poor. Being in the circulation, it pervades the whole body, and may burst out in disease on any part of it. No organ is free from its attacks, nor is there one which it may not destroy. The scrofulous taint is variously caused by mercurial disease, low living, disordered or unhealthy food, impure air, filth and filthy habits, the depressing vices, and, above all, by the venereal infection. Whatever be its origin, it is hereditary in the constitution, descending " from parents to children unto the third and fourth generation;" indeed, it seems to be the rod of Him who says, " I will visit the iniquities of the fathers upon their children."
Its effects commence by deposition from the blood of corrupt or ulcerous matter, which, in the lungs, liver, and internal organs, is termed tubercles; in the glands, swellings; and on the surface, eruptions or sores. This foul corruption, which genders in the blood, depresses the energies of life, so that scrofulous constitutions not only suffer from scrofulous complaints, but they have far less power to withstand the attacks of other diseases; consequently, vast numbers perish by disorders which, although not scrofulous in their nature, are still rendered fatal by this taint in the system. Most of the consumption which decimates the human family has its origin directly in this scrofulous contamination; and many destructive diseases of the liver, kidneys, brain, and, indeed, of all the organs, arise from or are aggravated by the same cause. 
One quarter of all our people are scrofulous; their persons are invaded by this lurking infection, and their health is undermined by it. To cleanse it from the system we must renovate the blood by an alterative medicine, and invigorate it by healthy food and exercise. Such a medicine we supply in 

AYER'S 
Compound Extract of Sarsaparilla, 
the most effectual remedy which the medical skill of our times can devise for this every where prevailing and fatal malady. It is combined from the most active remediate that have been discovered for the expurgation of this foul disorder from the blood, and the rescue of the system from its destructive consequences. Hence it should be employed for the cure of not only scrofula, but also those other affections which arise from it, such as ERUPTIVE and SKIN DISEASES, ST. ANTHONY'S FIRE, ROSE, or ERYSIPELAS, PIMPLES, PUSTULES, BLOTCHES, BLAINS and BOILS, TUMORS, TETTER and SALT RHEUM, SCALD HEAD, RINGWORM, RHEUMATISM, SYPHILITIC and MERCURIAL DISEASES, DROPSY, DYSPEPSIA, DEBILITY, and, indeed, ALL COMPLAINTS ARISING FROM VITIATED OR IMPURE BLOOD. The popular belief in "impurity of the blood" is founded in truth, for scrofula is a degeneration of the blood. The particular purpose and virtue of this Sarsaparilla is to purify and regenerate this vital fluid, without which sound health is impossible in. contaminated constitutions.

Ayer's Cathartic Pills,
FOR ALL THE PURPOSES OF A FAMILY PHYSIC,
are so composed that disease within the range of their action can rarely withstand or evade them. Their penetrating properties search, and cleanse, and invigorate every portion of the human organism, correcting its diseased action, and restoring its healthy vitalities. As a consequence of these properties, the invalid who is bowed down with pain or physical debility is astonished to find his health or energy restored by a remedy at once so simple and inviting.
Not only do they cure the every-day complaints of every body, but also many formidable and dangerous diseases. The agent below named is pleased to furnish gratis my American Almanac, containing certificates of their cures and directions for their use in the following complaints: Costiveness, Heartburn, Headache, arising from disordered stomach, Nausea,-Indigestion, Pain in and and Morbid Inaction of the Bowels, Flatulency, Loss of Appetite, Jaundice, and other kindred complaints, arising from a low state of the body or obstruction of its functions.

Ayer's Cherry Pectoral,
FOR THE RAPID CURE OF
Coughs, Colds, Influenza, Hoarseness, Croup, Bronchitis, Incipient Consumption, and for the relief of Consumptive Patients in advanced stages of the disease.
So wide is the field of its usefulness and so numerous are the eases of its cures, that almost every section of country abounds in persons publicly known, who have been restored from alarming and even desperate diseases of the longs by its use. When once tried, its superiority every other medicine of its kind is too apparent to escape observation, and where its virtues are known, the public no longer hesitate what antidote to employ for the distressing and dangerous affections of the pulmonary organs that are incident to our climate. While many inferior remedies thrust upon the community have failed and been discarded this has gained friends by every trial, conferred benefits on the afflicted they can never forget, and produced cures too numerous and too remarkable to be forgotten.

Is there any virtue in 
MRS. S. A. ALLEN'S 
WORLD'S 
HAIR RESTORER? 
READ THE FOLLOWING, AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.
TO THE ED'S OF EVANGELIST:-My age to sixty. One year ago, my hair was very gray, and had been gradually falling, until, on the crown, it had become quite thin. About the 1st of March, of the present year, I commenced using Mrs. S. A. Allen's ' Rastorer,' No. 1, according; to the directions. and have continued to apply a slight dressing of the name once in three or four weeks, on retiring to bed. My hair now almost restored to its original color, and the hue appears to be permanent. I AM SATISFIED THAT THE PREPARATION IS NOTHING LIKE A DYE, BUT OPERATES UPON THE SECRETIONS. My hair ceases to fall, which is certainly an advantage to one who was in danger of becoming bald.' Rev. M. THACHER
Bridgewater, Oneida Co., N. Y., Nov 22, 1855
President J. J, EATON, LL. D., Union University, Murfreesboro', Tennessee. 
'MADAM-I would state, that some time last spring I found MY HAIR FALLING OFF. I concluded to purchase a bottle of 'Mrs. S. A. Allen's World's Restorer,' &c, and give it a trial. I commenced using it, but very irregularly; but notwithstanding this irregularity, I found that its influence was distinctly visible, THE FALLING OFF OF HAIR CEASED and my locks, which before were quite GRAY WERE CHANGED TO BLACK. I do not consider that I have given it a fair trial, but, from what I have seen of its effects in my own case, I have reason to believe that it is capable of accomplishing what it purports to do, viz PREVENT THE HAIR FROM FAILLING OFF, and to RESTORE GRAY LOCKS TO THEIR ORIGINAL COLOR.' 
Mrs. D. W. CLARK, wife of Rev. D. W. CLARK. Editor 'Ladies' Repository,' Cincinnati, Ohio.
I have been using Mrs. S. A. Allen's Zylobalsamum with much satisfaction in dressing my own and children's hair. After trying various articles manufactured for the hair, I feel no hesitation is recommending yours as the best I have ever used.

Rev. A. WEBSTER, Editor ' Christian Era,' Boston, Mass. 
'Having used numerous specifics to little purpose, I discarded all, believing them to be of no value. So I regarded your World's Hair Restorer and Zylobalsamum, yet personal friends prevailed on me to use it. I have done so for several months past with good effect and entire satisfaction. I am now neither bald nor gray! my hair was dry and brittle, but has regained the softness of my earlier years.' 
Rev. H. V. DEGEN, Ed. ' Guide to Holiness,' Boston:
'Mrs. S. A. Allen's Worlds Hair Restorer found among our other advertisements, we insert from actual experiment. That it promotes the growth of the hair where baldness had commenced, we have now the evidence of our own eyes. We can testify to its good effects.' 
Rev. S. B. MURLEY, Pastor Congregational Church, Attleboro', Mass.
I have used Mrs. S. A. Allen's Word's Hair Restorer and Zylobalsamum. The effect of the Hair Restorer has been to change the 'crown of glory' which, belongs to old men to the original hue of youth. This was done by a single bottle used according to directions. Others of my acquaintance have used it with the same effect. The Zylobalsamum I regard as an invaluable dressing for the hair.' 
Rev. DANIEL T. WOOD, Middletown, Orange Co., N.Y 
'My hair has greatly thickened upon my head, and put on a very lively, healthy appearance. The same is true of my daughter; HER HAIR HAD BECOME THIN, AND CAME OUT CONSTANTLY, UNTIL WE THOUGHT THE HEAD WOULD BE ALMOST BARE; HER HAIR HAS HANDSOMELY THICKENED UP, AND ALSO HAS A HEALTHY APPEARANCE. We are thankful to you, and feel that we have full value of our money.'

Rev. W. B. THORNELOE, Present, Lancashire, England.
'Your Hair Restorer is a perfect marvel. After having used it for six weeks, my extremely gray hair was restored to its natural color,-not the wig-like appearance produced by dyes, but to its own natural color, which satisfies my mind that it is not a dye. I can strongly recommend it, and shall feel happy in answering the queries of any you may refer to me.'

Rev. R. H. PORLOCK, Ed, ' Presbyterian Witness,' Cincinnati, Ohio. 
'It is our settled policy to advertise nothing till we know it is what it purports to be. Having opportunity, and being satisfied of the merits of Mrs. S. A. Allen's Hair Restorer and Zylobalsamum, I would be pleased to insert advertisement,' &c. 
Rev. J. A. H. CORNELL, Corres. Sec. Board of Education R. D. Churth, 337 Broadway N.Y., and New Baltimore, Greene country, N. Y.

Rev. JAS. McFARLANE, Pastor Prot. Dutch Church, Esopus, Ulster county, N. Y. 
'I have no hesitation ia certifying that Mrs. S. A.

Rev. B. C. SMITH, Prattsburg, N. Y. 
'I was really surprised to and my gray hair soon turned as black as when I was a young man ' 
Rev. M. C. KLING, Lewistown, Pennsylvania,
'It has stopped the falling off of my hair, and caused a new growth, although I did not attend to it as your directions require.'

'We think very highly of your preparations, and have no doubt, if you had an agent in this vicinity, a large quantity might be disposed of.' 
Rev. Mrs. E. S.ANDRUS, (many years Missionary to Hayti,) Martinsburgh, N. Y.
In consequence of her long residence in aforenamed island her hair and scalp were in a very unhealthy condition. After trying various articles without success, and eventually using Mrs. S. A. Allens she writes to the Americans Baptist,'-'I have derived much benefit from the use of Mrs. S. A. Allen's Worlds Hair Restorer and Zylobalamum; I have tried many other remedies for my hair, but never any thing that so materially and permanently benefited me as those of Mrs. S. A. Allen.'
We think that if these fail to convince nothing less than a trial will. Some few dealers try to sell articles on which they make more profit than on these; always INSIST on having these.
These are the only preparations exported in any quantity to Europe.
We aspire to have the best, not the lowest priced. One bottle of the Restorer will lest a year; $1 50 a bottle. Balsam, 871/2 cents per bottle.
Address all letters for information, so., to 'Mrs. S. A. Allen's World's Hair Restorer Depot, No. 355 Broome Street, New York'. The Genuine has Mrs. S. A. Allens,' signed in Red Ink to outside wrappers and in Black Ink to directions pasted on bottles-none other is genuine. Signing the name by others to forgary, and will prosecuted by us as a criminal offence.

TO CAPT, JOHN BROWN, OF HARPER'S JERRY;
Or to his Memory.

SONNET I.
Ever it has been deemed a glorious deed
To draw the sword for Freedom. Greece and Rome
Enabled those who fought for freedom, home,
And much loved country, Statues were decreed,
And poets sang, and children lisped the name
Of him who was freed a nation; and his praise
Reaches through centuries to our own days.
Long-enslaved Italy, her ancient fame
Through all her States if eager to regain;
And Europe views her with approving eyes.
Ok, generous martyr to poor Slavery's cries!
Not on thy neck, but others' pressed the chain,
Yet its strong links weighed on thy pitying heart:
Oh, slave-deliverer, hone the 'better part'!

SONNET II.
Success is no true proof of a good cause,
Else had it followed thee, friend of the slave!
Nor is the If or it the breath of mobs the best applause
That cheers to noble deeds the truly brave.
See that rude couch, where, bleeding. Faint and pale,
The Negro's champion lies; yet firm, and true;
Then hear the Southern Chivalry assail
The half-dead man with questions, not a few.
What does that scene recall? Hast thou ne'er read?
Those sickening tales of Rome's, or Spaniard's den,
Whence Inquisitions' victims, faint, half-dead, 
From torture-dungeons borne by cruel men,
Were forced to listen and to give reply.
Their throbbing heads deafened by agony?
Tendered, (England.) JANE ASKBY.
For the Liberator.
LINES,
To our Pastor, the Rev. M.G. KIMBALL, for his brave words, spoken Dec.11th, 1859, in commemoration of martyrdom of John Brown.
Thanks for the earnest words so nobly spoken!
Thanks for the lesson we to-day have heard! 
Our hearts grew strong and braver while we listened,
As manly eloquence proclaimed the Word.
We felt how glorious is a true, free spirit.
That will not stoop for gain, or place, or power;
Or hide a nation's guilt with words smooth-spoken- That fallen not when comes the trial-hour.
That on Truth's altar, with a faith unshaken.
Will calmly lay each hope of worldly gain,
Content to lose fame, station, gain and power,
Rather then manhood's noble life to stain.
And when with words impassioned, strong and earnest,
We heard thee plead for a poor outcast race,
We felt each life-pulse throb with shame and sorrow,
That such foul sin our country should disgrace.
And when we heard thee tell of that brave Martyr,
Who for the slave went calmly out to die,
We felt how glorious 'twas a Life to offer,
At Freedom's shrine, with faith so strong and high.
And we, anew, within our hearts recorded
The solemn row to follow where Truth leads;
And never yield to Slavery's demon power,
For Church or State-for party, sect or creed.
Again accept our thanks; and, in the future,
Twill give thee joy to know thou hast been true;
And never in the path of duty faltered,
But sought our faith and strength to still renew.
May God reward thee, earnest, faithful Teacher!
Earth's richest gift-the soul's sweet peace-be thine!
And ever may'st at thou stand by Freedom's altar,
Content for Right the world's praise to resign.
Baren, Mass Dec., 1859, CARRIE.

WENDELL PHILLIPS.
Why the Southern Self-Styled 'Chivalry' call Wendell Phillips 'a nuisance.'
And so, Wendell Phillips 's a nuisance'!
Unhappy man! what has he done?
And how, m South Chivalry's usance,
Has he this new epithet won?
'He asserts that a negro's no chattel,
But a man, and that freedom 's his right;
Says 'tis wicked to sell with my cattle
A brother, because he's not white.
'Why, the man must be surely demented,
To tell as that toil is not play;
And our slaves are so gay and contented,
They don't sigh for freedom-not they.
'And we masters are so patriarchal,
And so gentle, and loving, and kind.
That the subjects of rulers monarchal
Must see slaves are best off, or be blind.
'Want freedom! White people must carry
The chain matrimonial for life;
But a slave's not permitted to marry,
And be plagued with a husband or wife.
'Want freedoms! The little white baby
Must have its fine clothes, and a nurse;
While the black one can wear its rags shabby,
And its weight help add weight to the purse
'Of its master. Want freedom! what folly
To say staves want freedom! They sing,
Dress and dance; they are idle and jolly;
Happy they as a queen or a king.
'How they hate the white men who entice them
From Slavery's pleasures to stray!
They love dearly the masters who price them,
And sell them down South, far away.
'Tis true, some few slaves have dissented
From their faith in all Slavery's joys,
And some parents have been discontented,
When sold from their girls and their boys;
'And some run away from their masters,
And seek freedom on Canada's shores;
But each family has same disasters-
Abolitionists all are great bores!
'And, to make our annoyances double,
When our gentle requests they don't heed,
We have some times the pleasure and trouble
To see our slaves flogged till they bleed.
'Tis no use to pretend a denial,
For Phillips would call it "a lie;"
We have had the additional trial
To see a twelve-hundred "boy" die,
Wendell Phillips's a terrible nuisance,
To expose all these troubles, and more;
So, according to "chivalvic" usance,
We vate Wendell Phillips a bore; 
'And if said Wendell Phillips be man,
We invite him to "come South," and see
If we hang him not high as hung Haman,
By our Lynch-law, on some forest tree.'
Tentarden,(England.) JANE ASKBY.
THE DEPARTED YEAR.
Another year is swallowed by the sea
Of sunless waves!
Another year, thou past eternity!
Hath rolled o'er new-made graves.
But there are things which time devoureth net;
Thoughts whose green youth
Flowers o'er the ashes of the unforgot!
And words whose fruit is truth.

THE LIBEBATOE. 
REMARKS ON THE RECENT EVENT AT HARPER'S FERRY,AND THE EXECUTION OF JOHN BROWN. BY REV.U.M.FISK,ON TAUNTON.
After all that has been written and said in regard to the affair at Harper's Ferry, and its melancholy SEQUEL it may be presuming in me to attempt to add anything. And I confess that I speak to-night, more from the fact that I derive to speak, then from any hope that I can cast new light upon the subject. Besides, I believe the pulpits of this town have been silent in regard to the matter; and I think such an event should not pass unnoticed by them.
On the second day of this month, John Brown was hung at Charlestown, Jefferson County, Virginia. What was the crime for which he was hanging? Let as endeavor to look at this question fairly, and answer it truthfully. For once, at least, let us endeavor to be impartial. Let as come oat from our parties, our churches, our commercial interests, and take a stand where we can look down upon all these plains; and where, if at all, we can see the tragic events referred to, in a truthful light.
If we really desire to form correct opinions on this subject, we most not inquire what laws, customs, or institutions John Brown violated: for all these may be based upon falsehood. But we must ask what natural human rights he infringed? What moral principle he violated? What Christian obligation he disregarded? And if the truthful answers to these questions find him guilty, let him be condemned; if not, let him be justified. Or, so far as he is found guilty or innocent, let him be condemned or justified. About ninety years ago, when the rulers of this country said they had a right to tax you, without your being represented in their legislature, you denied the right. When they said you should write on stamped paper, and pay a premium for it, you said you would not do it. When they sent tea here that was heavily taxed, yon threw it into the sea. And when, afterwards, they attempted to force you into submission, you deliberately took your swords and muskets, and slaughtered your oppressors, and drove them from the country.
And to-day, you look upon those who led you in that fight, as heroes; and upon those who fell, as martyrs; and the fields whereon they fought, as consecrated ground.
You believe the cause in which you took up arms was a righteous cause, and the bloodshed justified by every principle of justice and right. And, moreover, you believe that, in aiding you to freedom and independence, the French nation did perfectly right, and acted upon the golden rule of doing unto others as they would be done by.
But there were some men here, however, who did not believe your acts were right, and still sought to aid your oppressors. You called these men Tories; and to-day their descendants are ashamed of their forefathers. You were some 3,000,000 of people then, and thought yourselves quite a nation,-numerous enough to take a place among the nations of the earth.
Well, if you had a right to draw your swords, and take the lives of your rulers, because a tithe of you money was demanded, how much greater is the right to do likewise of the 4,000,000 of men and women whom we have robbed of every privilege, liberty, or prerogative which a human being most desires?
If you presumed to shed blood, because your right were slightly trespassed upon, much more may the slave shed blood, who stands without one poor privilege he can call his own! If you can look upon you blood-stained sword, and feel that the hand which grasps the weapon is not a criminal's, then the slave may slaughter till he is dripping with blood, and fee that every stain is a badge of honor!
You slew thousands of men, because a small portion of your money was demanded. But what if all your money had been demanded, and you, and your wives and children? What if your tyrants had come upon you, and bound you with literal chains, and worked you under the lash, and beaten you with rods, and starved you in prisons, and burned you at the stake, and put your wives and daughters upon the auction-block before your eyes, and sold them to the brutal ruffians who narrowly examined them with laughter and jeers?
Then had you drawn the knife to regain your rights, welt might you have appealed to the world and Heaven for the justice of your cause!
These wrongs that I have supposed might have been yours are actually the wrongs of the slave to-day. And now, beside his present cause of rebellion, how poor, how frivolous appears your revolutionary cause of quarrel!
You love the French, because they sympathized with, you in your slight oppression, and aided you to independence. But what shall I say of those who not only refuse to aid the slave, but who do not even sympathize with him in his great wrongs? What shall I say of a Republic whose every seventh citizen is a slave? What of a Supreme Court, claiming to be Christians, who teach us that 4,000,000 of men and women among us ' have no rights which we are bound to respect'? What of a Church that upholds this stupendous iniquity, while it daily whines its blasphemous prayers, and repeats its heartless professions? And what of a Ministry, who prate of duty and self-sacrifice, while they stand dumb before the prejudice in the pews, and feel themselves, as they are, the most abject cowards alive?
But I am glad the Government does not represent the people; that the Supreme Court is not the 'Higher Law'; that the Church does not contain the religion of the land; and that the Ministers are by no means the highest moral teacher.
I think God that we have a sense of right, which governments and courts can never destroy; that we have a love for humanity and truth, which a lying church and hypocrite priesthood can never quench; and that we have a living admiration of sincerity and independence, in spite of the selfish maxims of commerce and political chicanery.
Living here, in the North, some years ago, was a plain, quiet, practical man, who actually felt his brotherhood to humanity; who hated words and loved deeds; to whom the mere talk of the reformer was idle wind; and to whom the faithlessness and necromancy of the Church was the standing grief of his life. He was afflicted as few men ever were,-vex. with a living faith in the Sermon on the Mount. He actually believed it, and supposed it was meant to be practiced in the present lift! No wonder the world called him mad! Nothing surer then that he was mad, or else the world is.
The Church has made the Gospel a mere pack-horse to ride to glory on. It offers to let you mount, if you will get up in the prescribed way, and sit in the fashionable attitude, and call the beast the particular nickname which they have adopted. Religion is a very comfortable thing to profess leaving out the practice. It is exceedingly pleasant to sit quietly, and sing about 'the other side of Jordan.' But to go to work and practice religion, so as to bring 'the other side of Jordan' over here, is quite another thing.
This man believed that Christ came to the world, not as a cosmopolitan scope-goat-not to set up dogmas for men to quarrel about-not to be admired and believed in, simply-but to be followed as an example. And this wild faith is Christianity had the most luxuriant soil to grope in; for the blood of the Pilgrims were in. the believer's veins.
He looked back over five sires, and saw the progenitor who landed from the Mayflower on Plymouth Rack. The stream of Puritan blood had oily eddied into five hearts to reach his own. And it seems to have come to him full of the early fire-<illegible> Government <illegible> had' extended' it-and,
<c03>
failing into his veins with the light and glow of three centuries in it, it made him into what is becoming a rare sight among us,-a brave, free, incorruptible man.
This blood gave him the cool brain, the warm heart, he iron nerve, the indomitable will. It gave him the logical mind that sees straight to its conclusion; and the practical hand that follows of the thought and it gave him that shrewd common sense which makes the veil of sophistry that selfishness throws over the truth, as transparent as a web of gossamer.
This blood of the Pilgrims, mellowed by the light of a more liberal send loving faith then the early stock knew, and tempered by the warmth of a large and generous humanity, nourished into life a man whose angle arm has just now shaken this nation, and whose marvelous heroism has stirred the dullest pulse in the Land.
His blood is on the legal instruments of torture and death with which Virginia slew him; and his body sleeps in calm repose in the shadow of the rock of his own homestead; but John Brown lives in the loving regard of thousands of earnest hearts, whose sighs have been his funeral dirge, and whose honest tears are his most eloquent eulogium.
But did John Brown do right in going to Virginia to free slaves? Let me tell you what has been my candid opinion. When the first reports came, that less then a score of men had gone into Virginia with the intention of exciting a general insurrection among the slaves, and had been captured by force of arms at Harper's Ferry, I supposed the leader was some brain-less fanatic: for it was evident, that had he been the most accomplished military leader, and had the best appointed army in the world, he could not have succeeded in such an enterprise. And so, I thought it was some ill-advised plot, which would surely end in defeat, and bring its leaders to dishonorable death.
But when fuller reports came, and the smoke and dust of excitement had cleared away, the affair began to assume a different aspect: and it was only necessary to give John Brown time to speak for himself, to have him command the respect of the entire nation-even of bus bitterest foes.
Look at the testimony which Gov. Wise involuntarily bore in his behalf; the substance of which was, that he was one of the bravest, truest, and most magnanimous men he ever met.
When Gov. Wise looked upon John Brown, a prisoner, he saw a man whom all the authority and power of Virginia could not overawe or move. In his interview with his prisoner, I think Gov. Wise felt that he showed to a disadvantage. In his attempted exhortation to Brown, he found himself more then answered; and felt his position instantly changed from that of teacher to that of scholar.
In going to see his prisoner, Gov. Wise evidently expected to find a wild fanatic, who, being captured would be craven. But he found a man, who, though subdued, was every inch a king: a man who dared demand his rights, and defend his conduct, and advocate his sentiments, and speak what he thought of his foes, even in the face of the armed and angry mob who were howling for his blood.
No wonder that Gov. Wise should turn away in admiration, and say, in the most expressive language is knew how to use, that the prisoner was the ' gamest' man he ever saw! He had seen the heroes of the cock-pit before; but the phenomenon of a genuine hero of the Puritan stamp was new to him. His successors will be more familiar with them.
Enough of the man has now been revealed to us, so that we can judge of Aim and of his motives with tolerable accuracy: and enough of his plan, so that we can judge of the wisdom of it. In his address to the Virginia Court, when about to receive the sentence of death, he says, 'I deny every thing but what I have already admitted, of a design on my part to free slaves. I intended, certainly, to have made a clean thing of that matter, as I did last winter, when I went into Missouri, and there took slaves, without the snapping of a gun on either side, moving them through the country, and finally leaving them in Canada. I desired to have done the same thing again, on a much larger scale. That was all I intended, I never did intend murder, or treason, or the destruction of property, or to excite or incite slaves to rebellion, or to make insurrection.
I think there is not a candid man in the country, but who believes this statement to be correct: for by the most infallible proofs, John Brown has convinced even his worst enemies that his word can be relied on. Here, then, is his design - his entire design. But let us pass it by for a moment, to look at his plan. This was, it seems, to establish a depot of arms, ammunition and provision, in the fastnesses of the mountains, where a strong defense could be made; making bold sallies to rescue slaves, and obtain prisoners as hostages, and spoils to defray expenses: expecting that as soon as his purposes became known, the slaves quite generally would rise and flock to his standard, while many of the white citizens who are opposed to slavery would also heartily join his enterprise. And so confident was he of this that he had formed a Constitution for a Provisional Government which was to go into operation as soon as practicable.
Such-from all that has yet transpired-I conceive to have been substantially his plan. And I confess, that to me the scheme seems visionary and wild: but not so wild now, as it would have appeared three months ago. For Virginia herself has made such a scheme seem far more plausible and likely of success, then it would have appeared before the excitement and evident alarm and great military display which she has made and manifested for the past few weeks.
But I remember how easy it is to pronounce a plan unwise that hiss failed; and how little logic it requires to prove the wisdom of a scheme that has succeeded. But it seems to me that any plan which contemplates the forcible release of the slaves from servitude, at present, must be unsound. And therefore I could not sanction or approve such a plan. But I should disapprove it solely on the ground that it could not succeed. Brown confesses that he was deceived air regard to the readiness of the-elevate join an enterprise for their deliverance. And doubtless he was deceived in regard to the action of some men who were not slaves. This is all I desire to say of his plan. Now let us look at his motives.
It is difficult for us, who live, and think, and labor, solely for ourselves, to appreciate the motives of a man who labors unselfishly for others. We are so utter strangers to such motives, that when we see them acted upon, we think the workman is a lunatic or madman; and the cry of eighteen centuries ago is echoed again, 'He hath a devil!'
How can we comprehend such a man, trained as we are in the precepts and practices of almost thorough selfishness? You and I, who grudgingly give a few pence to the poor now and then; and possibly feel, at long intervals, a little sympathy with the afflicted and oppressed; what do we know of the man who feels, and thinks, and toils continually for the helpless and down-trodden? I presume we should say of Christ, that he was the varies fanatic, if we had not been catechized into the belief that it would be very naughty to say so, and that possibly it might affect our standing at Head-quarters!
Thus is our very religion bottomed on selfishness? We think we are Christians, when we are only political religionists,-scrambling for comfortable situations, and praying that a pleasant nook may be reserved for as when we are sent to the other land.
But who stops to lift the burden from the shoulders of his toted brother, to take up the wounded by the wayside of life, to deliver him who has fallen among thieves, and to say to the tyrant whose foot Is on his brother's meek, 'Letup!' Not we!-and of the man who does do it, we cry, madman! Fool! Agitator! Dissolver of the Union!
I know that, on Sunday, in chruch, we believe in
<c04>
Christ, who bade us be loving, and generous, and just; and to sacrifice everything for the sake of the right. And I know, too that through the week we believe in somebody else, who tells us to keep what we've got, and get what we can; and leave self-sacrifice to fanatics and Sunday professions. And even those professions must be so softly uttered, that the echo won't get out disturbing our commercial interests.
Talk about the 'hardened and bigoted' Jews stoning their prophets, and killing those who stood for the truth! Do you suppose the world has got done murdering the honest and self-sacrificing? Why don't your ministers here speak truthfully what they feel, and all they feel? Because you'll kill them, if they do. At least, you'll try to; and if you don't succeed, it won't be for lack of intention. You call men to instruct you morally, and then tell them just what to say, and how much! You'll make progress at that rate.
Now let us look for a moment at one of the world's 'fools,'-remembering that God takes just such instruments with which to confound the wise. The early life of John Brown was such as to make him self-reliant, thoughtful, hardy, and brave. It led him away from so-called 'good society'; but so much the better for him; it left him uncorrupted, and gave him a chance of becoming a man. It taught him to think with Nature's logic that asks what truth is and how much we can get of it; and not with society's logic that is always asking how much of the truth it will be safe to use!
He was a bashful man; suffering more from diffidence, he tells us, then from all other fear. Fortunate again here. Our bashful boys are always our best thinkers, most sympathetic, and purest-hearted. The man who subdued kings on this continent was so bashful, that in rising before Congress to acknowledge the honor of a vote of thinks, he broke down without saying a word. The man, who blushed before the flash of Beauty's eye, is not apt to blanch before the flash of cannon.
Brown was trained in the use of arms. It is a singular fact, that so far in the world's history, the best men have handled swords. If you doubt this, think of Washington and St. Peter!
In his later youth he studied theology, with a view to entering the ministry; but his studies were interrupted by a fortunate attack of inflammation in the eyes. Here he was lucky again. For, had he fallen among the priests, the chances are, that he would have gone to work, like them, in some theological treadmill, 'that he might eat a piece of bread.'
But this intention of his led him to study the Scriptures, which, as he escaped the trammels of sectarianism, was one of the best things that could have happened to him. If gave him a true idea of duty, and a lofty sense of right; and, as he did not take on the shackles of the Church, it left him with some freedom to act out his convictions. And it left the simple words of Christ-unshorn of their force by false interpretation-impressed upon an earnest soul, that loved the obligation they imposed. And the commands, 'Go thou and do likewise,' and, 'Remember those in bonds as bound with them,' he looked upon as spoken to himself; and in the simplicity of his heart, he sought to obey them.
We next find him on a farm in New York, where he continues his obscure, though most manly and independent occupation, until the commencement of the troubles in Kansas. When he saw the strong arm and stout heart needed in that territory, he went there, and supported the Right by word and blow. He was there for deeds; and right bravely and nobly did he do them. When summoned to a council of war, his Spartan reply was, 'Tell the General when he wants to fight, to send for me!'
With the loathing of a true soul, he hated cowards and liars, and hypocrites. The profane sweater was not allowed in his company; and it came to be an evidence of high moral rank to be found the companion of Old John Brown.
When the strife in that territory ended, and he saw that Slavery could not plant its bloody footsteps there, he came eastward again; but not to forget the cause of Freedom and the oppressed. The wronged, the plundered, the degraded,-he carried them kin his heart; and in the constant darkness of the present, his manly hand was ever feeling for the bolt that barred them in, that he might open their prison doors and bid them go out free.
It was the study of his life how best to fight the giant wrong of this land, and release those who are crushed and bleeding beneath its hoof. Look at him as he was, when he stood here among us, contemplating the wrongs of the slave, and devoting his life to their removal. Let us glance at the scene which appeared before him, and think of it as he undoubtedly looked upon it. Here was one of the first nations in the world that started as the champion of inalienable human rights and human equality, now utterly recreant to its early principles, and become the open defender and propagandist of the most inhuman tyranny the world ever saw.
He saw 4,000,000 human beings actually degraded as much below the level of the brutes, as their natural humanity and consciousness are above the brutes. He saw them wronged and oppressed in every manner that selfishness, and lust, and revenge can dictate. Among them he saw churches, and ministers, and statesman, claiming to be Christian; while the statesmen said, that 'religion and humanity have nothing to do with politics; interest alone is the governing principle with nations.' And the priests said, that 'slavery is a divine institution, ordained of God from the beginning.' So they propped the auction-block with Bibles; and trafficked in women and children according to religion; and wrote texts upon their fetter; and bred human beings for the market by Scripture rules; and drove them in gangs to the rice-swamps to the cheering music of devout psalms!
He saw that these 4,000,000 men and women were claimed as the property of three hundred thousand other men and women; I. E., that the oppressed were thirteen times more numerous then the oppressors. And yet, the will of this handful of tyrants was the power and the law of the land! Every one of them, including the women and children, being equal in political power to seven freemen of the North.
He saw that every officer of government, from the littlest Postmaster of the littlest town, up to the President, was the creature and the tool of this slave-oligarchy. And over all, he saw a Supreme Court, whose members have lived until their locks are whitened by the snows of many winters, but whose frosts, alas! Have frozen the humanity in their hearts, so that they can promulgate sentiments which pirates everywhere will approve, and the most ruffian and brutal selfishness rejoice in; a court in which all political fogeyish seems to culminate and petrify, which says that every seventh human being among us 'has no rights which we are bound to respect'! While under all, he saw the brutalized and helpless salve,-now well clothed and fed, with home, and wife, and children,-now chained in the market-place, and sold to the highest bidder,-now pampered and caressed, then beaten with rods, mangled by bloodhounds, burned at the stake,-tortured by every process that fiendish souls can invent. And he heard the low prayer from a thousand huts, asking Heaven again and how long the night shall last! And he heard, too, the despairing wail of the helpless mother and child flying through the trackless forests, as they heard the bay of the savage dogs upon their track!
And in view of all these wrongs,-this two hundred years' bondage of an outraged people,-in chains without a crime, stricken without a provocation,-plundered and degraded for no other reason then that God had colored their skins!-in view of these horrible wrongs, I say, John Brown asked, not politicians or churches, but God, what was his duty in the premises!
And God said to him, 'If thou undo the heavy burden, and break every yoke, and let the oppressed
<c05>
Go free, then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noonday; thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of the Lord shall be thy rear-ward.' And, looking all the consequences in the face, he gathered a few friends around him, and deliberately prepared for the encounter, and went calmly down into the shadow of slavery, and struck as he was able for the freedom of the oppressed.
But whether wise and expedient or not, was it right for John Brown to go into Virginia, sword in hand, to free slaves? I do not ask if it was legal, constitutional politic, but only if it was right? If the logic of Bunker Hill was sound, then John Brown was right. If the Massachusetts Bill of Rights is common sense, or it the Declaration of Independence is true, then John Brown was right.
If Lafayette was a hero, John Brown is more a hero. If Rogers, Ridley, Latimer, were martyrs. John Brown was more a martyr. They died for religious rights only but him for every right that man can exercise.
If their was noble, Brown's was Christ-like: for they died for their own rights, but he for the rights of the friendless and oppressed.
No right, had he, to go into Virginia to free slaves? What right has Virginia to hold slaves? The same right that you have to meet your neighbor to-night, and rob him of his money. The same right that these gamblers in your dens have to fleece their silly victims. The same right that the pirate on the high seas has to the merchant ship he has captured.
Why, Virginia herself says that the man who goes to Africa, and sells or buys her people, and is taken with them on the high seas, shall be treated as a pirate. And yet that man holds his cargo of slaves by precisely the same right as does every planter on the soil of Virginia. He has not committed one single offence more then every slaveholder has. Nay, he has not committed so great offence; for just in proportion to the increased intelligence of a man, and his consequent stronger desire for liberty, in just that proportion the crime of his enslavement increases.
So, the man who steals men on the coast of Congo is much less a criminal then he who holds more intelligent men in bondage in Virginia. One man, with a cargo of human beings on the high seas, is a pirate, is he? While 15,000 men on land, holding 300,000 human beings in bondage, are gentlemen and Christians-the chivalry of the nineteenth century!
This is the political, the Republican, nay, the Christian logic of the men of America to-day! Such, taken as a whole, are the Democracy and the Christianity which we hold up before the world.
Well may the world cry shame upon us! Well may the reformer in Europe pause before he asks for a Republic! And well may Hindustan bar its gates against the hideous religion we offer her!
Then, if Virginia has no right to hold slaves, except the right which heartless and soulless Power always claims over the weaker party; then John Brown had a right to go into her territory, and help her victims to escape. And, more then this, it was his duty to do so, if he thought he could do it successfully.
I have said before, that I could not approve of an armed invasion, but solely on the ground of its impracticability. But that is a question for every man to settle for himself. Brown felt he could succeed,-and went-and failed-and then succeeded beyond his farthest hope.
He had a higher mission then he knew of. He went there to aid the slave, but God sent him to dies for him. He went there to show what love and generosity could do; and, possibly, what heroism was upon the battle-field.
But the exhibitions demanded of him were of a higher nature then these. The world wanted to see how a Christian hero could die. We needed to be shown what manhood there was yet among us, and what it could do under the most trying circumstances. We wanted to know what unselfishness signifies-what integrity meant-what moral honesty was, in actual life, and when put to the extremist test.
We needed to be told yet again, what Slavery does with a live Christian-to see what the Courts of this country would do with the man who dared to practice the Sermon on the Mount-to hear what the ministers and churches would say of one who not only believed, but followed the precepts of their Master.
All these things we have now seen and heard. We have seen that Slavery demands the blood of every practical Christian within her borders-that her Courts convict of murder and treason every one who dares to act upon the Golden Rule-and that a majority of the ministers and churches of the land condemn the man who adds to the humanity of the Good Samaritan, the heroism of the defender of the oppressed.
Look at that single man in the grasp of a great State-wounded nigh to death-helpless-his friends scattered, or fallen around him-the mangled corpse of a son by his side, and another in the death-agony before him.
See him thus, as he is approached by the representatives of the highest power and authority of the State; and does he quail-nay, even waver? Does he ask for mercy? Does he deny his purposes? Does he retract his principles?
When reproached with being a criminal, he calmly replies that he is not a criminal: that it is they who are criminals.
When the canting exhortation to repentance is made to him, he tells them it is they who have need of repentance, for the wrongs and blood of outraged thousands bear witness in heaven against them.
Thus, in face of a furious mob, who were yelping for his blood,-hemmed in by swords and bayonets that were eager for his life,-confronted by the first officers and Chief Magistrate of the State,-he declared his purposes, his convictions of truth and duty, and even his opinion of his enemies,-maintained the justice of his acts, and demanded his rights,-till the military looked on in admiration and envy of his courage, and even the Governor turned away confounded and in pleased astonishment at a man whom no defeat could humble, no approaching fate intimidate, and no authority overawe.
Look at him through his trial, and see the same dignity and courage and candor attend him there. Think of that marvelous speech before the Court-eloquent with child-like simplicity and candor:-
'Had I so interfered in behalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelligent, the so-called great, or in behalf of any of their friends, either father, mother, brother, sister, wife, or children, or any of that class, and suffered and sacrificed what I have in this interference, it would have been all right. Every man in this Court would have deemed it an act worthy a reward, rather then a punishment.'
And they, and you, and I know that these words are true.
See him in the solitary trials of the prison,-the hardest trials of all: and there is no word of regret, of weakness, of compliant, but a Socratic heroism and fortitude, which make him the peer of any martyr whose death has ever hallowed a noble cause.
In the last, fearful hour, he seems to have been the calmest actor in that tragic scene. Taking a kind farewell of his friends, and thinking his jailor for his kindness, he calmly mounts the scaffold, and, while the instruments and appendages of legal murder are being adjusted to him, merely requests that there be no unnecessary delay; then quietly waits some ten horrible minutes for the awkward cavalry to take up their position, when the fall of the trap leaves suspended by the neck the best manhood in Virginia.
Say what you will of political expediency, of laws and Constitutions; John Brown was hung for attempting to succor the needy, to relieve the oppressed, and to take off the chains from him who was wrongfully bound.
On the day that he died, millions of the best hearts in the world beat in sympathy for him; and the hatred of millions of souls against slavery were intensified:-the hour-hand of Progress went forward on the clock
<c06>
Of Time; and Slavery took a day's march towards the field of its red death.
'There is a charm in the coming years,
Agape for strife's Niagara of blood-
Or to be bridged by brave hearts linked in love.'
Not in vain has John Brown fallen in the cause of Freedom. His death broke out another rivet in every shackle that binds God's image in the dust.
Every slave may have a higher hope, and every lover of human rights think God that another martyr's blood is thrown into the scale where Oppression is being weighed by the hand of Eternal Justice.
'What though; the Martyrs and Prophets have perished;
The Angel of Life rolls the stone from their graves;
Immortal's the love and freedom they cherished,
Their faith's triumph-cry stirs the spirits of slaves!
They are gone-but a glory is left incur life,
Like the day-god's last kiss on the darkness of even-
Gone down on the desolate seas of their strife,
To climb as star-beacons up Liberty's heaven.
Slaves cry unto God! But be our God revealed
In our lives, in our works, in our warfare for man;
And bearing-or borne upon-Victory's shield,
Let us fight battle-harnessed, and fall in the van.
Tread calmly on, in the mad world's despite,
Nurse the faith in thy heart; keep the lamp of God bright,
And, my life for thine! It shall end in the Right.'

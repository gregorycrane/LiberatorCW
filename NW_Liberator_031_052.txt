THE EMANCIPATION LEAGUE.
The evening of to-day is to give us the address of Ex-Governor Boutwell upon "the justice, expediency and necessity" of emancipating the colored laboring population of the South. Could the subject be looked at, free from the sophistications thrown around it by enthusiasts or interested demagogues, it would be at once seen that the project is one which, if successful, could only avail to free the slaves from labor, and at the same time from means of support. So wild and ruinous a scheme as this would, of course, receive no countenance from rational men, even it be carried out. But all such men know that it is as much out of the question, as it would be to change the direction of the Alleghany chain from the East to the West of the Great Lakes. Earnest and benevolent, but unreflecting natures may indulge in such a dream, perhaps without any harm to the body-politic. But when wrought to frenzy, by constantly contemplating their object, and by vainly struggling against the obstacles to it, so that all their philanthropy is-turned into gall and bitterness, then they do incalculable mischief to social peace and order in the community by which they are harbored, certainly without advancing their cause a hair's breadth Whenever such a scheme is taken up by the demagogue and used for political purposes, then its real mischiefs become fully apparent, and the conflict is, as in this case, between their own selfishly ambitious purposes and the very organization and administration of the Government of the country. The object proposed by the �Emancipation League." to be expounded by Mr. Boutwell this evening, is in open opposition to the Constitution, and to the declared and loyal policy of the Administration, and is, in all respects, as hostile to the Union as Secession, in its most violent and relentless manifestation.
The doctrine to be enforced by Mr. Boutwell will undoubtedly be-indeed, it appears by the announcement of his subject-that slavery is the cause of the existing national struggle, and therefore slavery must be abolished, in order to bring the conflict to an end. But in fact slavery, it is plain, is not the cause, except so for as it has been forced into the arena by Mr. Boutwell and his confederates. For the period of more than half a century, under the Constitution, the question of slavery was no disturbing element in the affairs of the country, and offered no impediment to its progress and prosperity. It first began to be so when English emissaries, (like Thompson, <illegible> member of Parliament,) and English money were employed here, to make Southern slavery the means of breaking down the manufactures of the North; and when Garrison and his followers in concert with them created a small faction, which still would have been utterly contemptible but for the fatal hour when the old Whig party was destroyed, by the coalition of its free soil members with the free soil Democracy, in which arrangement Mr. Boutwell himself played so conspicuous a part. This made him Governor of Massachusetts, and Mr. Sumner a Senator of Massachusetts in Congress; and the evil influence and evil example spread, until we are where we are. And to this object Mr. Boutwell has given himself ever since. But for him and others of like disposition, in the Peace Conference at Washington, in February last, who showed the most pertinacious resolution not only to do nothing for peace, but to prevent it, we need have had no war. But as their design was, as now, to push the quarrel against slavery to the utmost extremity, they could not consent to peace, which would have frustrated that object, and with it their own political hopes.
We have thus seen the convulsion of the country, the horrors, trials and sufferings of the dreary, anxious summer. We have seen how far and how gradually, step by step, all such purposes have been compelled to give way, in a political point of view, to the inexorable demands of the case. We have seen how, if the theory of Mr. Boutwell and his compatriots had been insisted on by the Government, the war must have been ended long ago by inevitable separation; and that the struggle and the Government have been sustained, because of the resistance to that theory by all men who seriously regarded the Constitution and loved the Union; and that to this class we owe every hope that we now have of restoring the government of the Union. And yet now, at this late and most inopportune moment, we have in Massachusetts a "League " secretly organized, to widen the breach; and Mr. Boutwell is at length to introduce and commend it to public favor, by showing "the justice, expediency, and necessity of Emancipation." The project is equally impudent, seditious and treasonable. It is unjust, because it violates the constitutional securities of half the people; inexpedient, because it conflicts with the conscientious convictions of more than half the rest and because insuperable obstacles, both physical and moral, make it impossible in the nature of things; and thus, what is neither just nor expedient cannot be necessary, since nothing is necessary, which we cannot do, and which we ought not to attempt.
In one word, nothing could be more foolish, or more prejudicial to the cause of the country, than the mischievous scheme to be thus inaugurated under the auspices of Mr. Boutwell. Supposing there were any reasonable degree of unanimity in the North, in favor of emancipation, we could do nothing by attempting it, but instantly to give renewed strength to the South. We might thus lose every advantage we now have, and dissolve the Union beyond all hope of recall, and wake up to find, that instead of emancipation, we had made slavery altogether independent of our efforts and our influence, the �corner stone of another nation, relentless, immovable and perpetual. But in the North there is no such unanimity. Three quarters of its people love the Union, and will, therefore, resist this flagitious scheme. 
Some persons have expressed surprise that we should refuse to accept money to insert a notice of the meeting of to-night, and yet should make it still more known by deliberate comments upon it. But our object is to make it as widely known as we can, in its true character, in order to show the noxious character of the plan on foot. We will not aid to give anything of such evil omen the same legitimate currency in these columns which we would give to meeting for, honest purposes. The President recently well characterized the Emancipation project as �a John Brown raid on a gigantic scale.� In view of the gathering strength and confidence of the country, and of the lately declining hopes and cause of the South, the only serious obstacle to a final and not very far distant restoration of all things is the organized political abolition party, which designing and vicious men in Congress and in the country are endeavoring to interpose to prevent the settlement, and thus to destroy the Union. We have most reason to dread its evil influence in New England; and here every patriotic man must set his face against it, unless he is willing to see it spread and gain a power, which by and by will lead to still harsher experiences. We cannot keep away a certain crowd from such assemblies. But we can at
<c02>
least let them know that we understand them, and give them no direct or indirect countenance. Let the better sense of the community make them feel, that their schemes are looked upon as equally futile and wicked, and they will soon run out, as, in any event, they must in the end.-Boston Courier.

THE EMANCIPATION LEAGUE.
The Emancipation League is now in full blast. The furnace is heated ten times hotter than ever, and the whole pack of Anti-Slavery, Abolition devils are at work to make Bedlam appear lovely and inviting. The black spirits who have rebelled against Heaven, and who have been hurled down from their high estate, are busily engaged in their endeavors to decoy the innocent and unsuspecting into their emancipation net. Degradation loves to pull down society to its own level, and is found ready at all times to sneer at virtue, and to rebel against the established order of things. It seeks its own aggrandizement by the substitution of recklessness for sobriety, and in the pulling down of the pillars upon which the social fabric rests. They are the outcasts-of society, and the vultures which prey upon a nation's vitals. They are incapable of building up, and can only destroy. It requires a skilful mechanic to plan and construct an edifice, but any ignorant dolt with a crowbar can level it to the ground. So with these miserable demagogues; they cannot construct; they can only destroy. They are not content to abide the will of the Almighty in his great plan of progress and gradual emancipation of mankind from darkness to light. They do not see that progress is a plant of slow growth. They do not see that their efforts tend to clog the wheels of true emancipation of the great mass of the people from despotism to civil and religious liberty. They do not see that the people throughout the world are struggling for constitutional liberty, and that constitutional liberty is in danger upon the American continent, in consequence of secession and emancipation dogmas. Already the nation is involved in civil war, and European governments are threatening us with their fleets and armies. The cities of Boston and New York, where these mischief makers are giving utterance to their treasonable sentiments, are in danger of becoming the abode of the enemies of the American Republic.
These agitators are the opponents of human freedom and of progress; they are the enemies of the slave, and are riveting their chains more firmly than before. They, as well as the disunionists at the South, are alike to be dreaded by the true friends of the Union and the Constitution. The people should turn upon them, and send them into retirement, before they have had time to accomplish their wicked purposes.-Boston Herald.
MR. SUMNER'S TRUE POSITION.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11, 1861.
Prominent Senators and Representatives in Congress are asserting their right and duty to consider everything and to discuss everything, whether relating to war or to peace, to freedom or to slavery. The right is unquestionable, but the duty does not appear so plain. The Senator from Massachusetts, (Mr. Sumner,) whose catch-words are "patriotism," "honor," "bravery," "courage," and "nobility;" who denounces the principles of men in arms for the defence of the Government; while in sight and sound of the enemy's guns, he stands up in the Senate Chamber uttering his denunciations; who charges the foe in columns of brave words, put into leaden type, and worked off upon iron presses, while his old peers in the Senate charge upon the capital and country with iron bayonets and leaden bullets, and brass and iron cannon; who is fierce for more invective and more assaults upon all that for seventy years has made us one government and one people. Even in the burial services of the dead, he mingles his sectional hate and personal wrath.
Such a man will never consent to a peaceful reunion of the States, nor to an equal representation of all the States in the Federal Congress. He deeply wounds the self-sacrificing, loyal Union men of the border States and far South; in every breath he utters, and in every speech he makes, he sets back upon the clock of advancing time the our hand of Peace. His presence in the Senate Chamber is a signal of protracted war, renewed sectional hate and offensive intermeddling. Rude in manners and coarse in ideas, there is nothing even in his refined language or classic illustrations to compensate for his rancorous and malignant thoughts. O that Massachusetts, so many years honored by the presence of her Webster in the Senate House of the country, whose history was founded upon the ideas of John Adams and James Otis, whose battles were fought by her Warrens, should be thus maligned by one who, in the words of one of her own sons-" having neither the wisdom of Ulysses for the council, nor the courage of Achilles for the battle, with the gray hairs of Nestor, is perpetually playing the part of the snarling Thirsites."
If Massachusetts were to-day represented in the spirit of her early Revolutionary men, or in the spirit in which so many thousands of her sons have rushed to the defence of the country, Mr. Sumner, as a long-standing enemy of the Constitution and the Union, would be sent back to Boston, and there sandwiched between Slidell and Mason, within the casements of Fort Warren. These three men are each old acquaintances here, and each old enemies of the Government, the Union and the Constitution; and the only difference between the extremes is, that the Senator from Boston remains in council here to fight the Government, and men and institutions belonging to it, from its foundation, while the others fled from its service to render more available aid to those in arms against it. It is at worst a successful sentiment of treason, in the one case, where the guilty party is rewarded for his offence from the public treasury, and the bolder act of open treason, in the other case, for which the offender is justly arrested and imprisoned.
If it be really treason "to give aid and comfort and to the enemy," there are but few worse enemies of constitutional liberty between Boston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, than Charles Sumner of Massachusetts. These are unpleasant words to write from the Capitol of the country in a time of civil war; but when the Government is struggling for its very existence, and is assailed by a whole confederacy of domestic enemies, and by so many sympathizers from abroad,-when unity of purpose and action is absolutely necessary for a successful victory of our arms, they are demanded; while all loyal men will fight for the Government and for the Constitution, under the flag of the country, none, who are faithful to all these, will raise any other standard. Negro Emancipation at the South-except as a purely war measure against rebellion-and the principles of Abolition at the North, where there are no slaves, form no part of a legitimate warfare for the restoration of the Union.-Editorial correspondence N.Y. Express.

Selections.
THE SHIP OF STATE BOUND FOR TARSHISH.
Extract from a Sermon, preached in the First Congregational Church in Sandwich, Mass.) Nov. 21, 1861, by Rev. Henry Kimball. Text-Jonah, I. 7, 11-15.
Who is the Jonah that testifies to us of himself, "I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you"? Is it Abolitionism? I know this is the accredited cause of all the mishaps and national calamities of thirty years' standing. But what is its sin? Is it wicked to be an Abolitionist? What is there in this hated term which should make it a reproach to bear it? What is Webster's definition for this hideous monster? He tells us that an Abolitionist is "one who favors the immediate emancipation of slaves." This is his crime: loving his neighbor as himself. For who is there who would not favor his own immediate and instantaneous emancipation? For loving his neighbor's liberty as well as he does his own, he is hated of all men, and the target for the infuriated mob, and is to be held answerable for all the blood shed upon the "sacred soil," as well as all the carnage and expectant woes of this age and nation. This, then, is the poor Jonah who has fled from the presence of the Lord. Is cowardice a peculiarity of Abolitionism? Yet, was not Jonah a moral coward, who dared not preach to Nineveh its sins, and warn of judgments? Are Abolitionists peculiarly notorious for their unwillingness to speak out? When did Abolitionists ever take ship for Tarshish? Yes, for this sin of loving a hated race; for unwillingness to keep still while the whip is lifted over four millions of human beings in this land of liberty; because they cannot so stifle conscience and imbrute their nature as to call such an institution divine, patriarchal, biblical, Christian, apostolic and humane, all the calamities of this war are to be visited upon them! Fling overboard all those who entertain ideas hostile to slavery, and where would you find Christian sailors to man the ship of State? Abolitionism, and humanity, and Christianity, and love for a world perishing, are so linked together, that if one goes overboard, all must follow. As the leader of a sheep-fold, going over London bridge, for fright leaps into the Thames, and all the flock follow him, so do all the organized forces follow, as of one flock, the leading force of Christianity, its humanity. Christianity, deprived of its philanthropy, is a shell without the kernel-a corpse. So, <illegible> is a friend to all men.
It is plain to any one, that the guilty Jonah in the hold of the vessel must be that trembling culprit which confesses, yea, boasts now before all the world, its power to raise and rule unto ruin the storm which, is now raging. What is that power which has made and unmade Presidents ever since we of the free North basely compacted in the National Convention for the formation of our inglorious Constitution, to catch and deliver up to life-long bondage the bloodtracked victim at bay by Southern bloodhounds? Who have been our masters for all time within the recollection of any soul here? What has divided presbyteries, tract societies, associations, churches, put brethren at variance, used the Bible to bolster up all its declining villanies, and perverted the temple of God into a temple of discord? What system of iniquity has corrupted judges, burned out all the patriotism over one half this nation, and terribly blighted all the rest; written decay and sterility upon all the fair plains of its wide domains; worn out the fertility of the richest natural soil of this heritage of man; stopped the free utterances of its own devotees; made freedom of thought and conscience a reproach; established a censorship over the press a gag upon the pulpit, and visited a felon's fate upon any man who dared be a whole Christian in accordance with the golden rule of love to all men? What is it that has torn asunder wife and husband, son and father, daughter and mother-yea, the babe from the breast, and sold it into bondage for life? What has made a human soul a thing of sale-made concubinage no crime, and adultery a right? What is it in short, that has poisoned the morals of whole sections, and blighted the freshness of all our land? Tell me what it is that has done this?-has struck down Senators while doing their duty to the State-has made the legislative halls of our nation a bar-room of obscenity, of abuse, of brawling and bludgeoning? What serpent has coiled itself slowly but silently around the liberties of our nation, and is now giving it the death strangle? What arm is now uplifted to commit the crime of matricide as the grand finale of all its crimes, the summing and sublimation of all its villanies, in one act, to close the scene? This is the Jonah. Need I speak more of "American slavery, the vilest that ever saw the sun, the sum of all villanies"? Verily, is it fleeing from the presence of the Lord? This is our Jonah. And now what shall we do with the cause of all this fearful storm that howls along the sky, and makes the timbers of State creak and groan and tremble,- that brings down upon us all the thunders of offended Heaven? And what shall we do with our Jonah, now that we have found him?
Behold, in our storm, bow the men on board the ship of State avoid the issue! Jonah is still protected, still nourished by our bounty; still down in the hold of the ship is slavery. Why, our armies seem far more ready to catch fugitives than to destroy the evil which is the cause of all our misfortunes. So we conserve our Jonah. Doubtless, they of the Tarshish-bound vessel thought by hard rowing they might reach land, and then the evil might removed and saved. Oh, we are so economical we must save the fare! Just like this policy is the buying up all the slaves. The colonization scheme-Oh, what hard rowing has there been here for these thirty years past! We cannot bear to waste and lose forever our Jonah. But there is always one termination to all such compromises. The longer we row, the more do we waste our wares, until there is nothing left but an empty ship, and the crew and Jonah together all to go down to the bottom at last. When we have wasted our fair soil, spoiled all its products, assumed a debt of two thousand million dollars, had our armies cut in pieces, poured out the noblest blood of the North, worn out the patience of all other nations; when they are just ready to interfere, and take our liberties from us forever,-then, and not till then, perhaps, we shall begin to see what true policy is. So long as there is a bale of cotton on board that is left to be pitched into the briny deep, we cannot spare our Jonah. I suppose there is not a sane man living who would deny that the overthrow of slavery would finish this war as well as bring down all as rebeldom; and yet, because we have compacted in 1789 to catch their slaves, we keep an army of four hundred thousand men to protect slavery for a set of rebels that shoot down our soldiers in the very act of upholding the Constitution!
Perhaps we shall learn ultimately, when our forces are all spent, and we sink down exhausted in our 
<c04>
vain attempts to baffle Providence, that, if we would cure the disease, we must cut away the cancer. This, doubtless, was in the minds of the crew who rowed so hard to reach land. They had contracted with Jonah to carry him to Tarshish, and they must fulfil their agreement. Notwithstanding Jonah's advice, "Take me up, and cast me forth," they keep on rowing hard for the land. The truth was, Jonah was God's "contraband," and they had no right with him. They had no business but to let go God's property. They were bound to rid themselves of him at once, or suffer shipwreck for all. Just so when our people agreed to protect slavery, to harbor it, to endure its presence one moment on board the ship of State, they made an unlawful contract, "a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell," and, in the sight of Heaven's "higher law," an unconstitutional one. If I agree to steal a purse or a person, I am doing an unconstitutional act, and the first duty I owe is to break the agreement. So those who promised to protect slavery will always be in the storm, until they break their guilty promise, and repent of their sin.
Like the crew of the ship which bore the prophet of Nineveh, we next come to prayer, and no sooner do we call upon the Lord, and complain that he is bringing innocent and guilty men to shame, than He shows us our duty to clear ourselves of this guilt; and then, nerved by the spirit of prayer, under the approval of a clear conscience, and with the consent of the cause of all the trouble itself, we address ourselves to an unwelcome duty, and we take up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea, and the sea ceases from its raging.
GEN. BUTLER'S EXPEDITION-PROCLAMATION OF GEN. PHELPS. General Butler's expedition has landed safely at Ship Island, Mississippi. Immediately after landing his command, Brigadier General Phelps, commander of the troops, issued the following proclamation, which was publicly read for the first time on Wednesday evening in the saloon of the Constitution: -
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLESEX BRIGADE, Ship Island, Miss., 
Dec. 4, 1861. 
To the Loyal Citizens of the Southwest:
Without any desire of my own, but contrary to my private inclination, I again find myself among you as a military officer of the Government. A proper respect for my fellow-countrymen renders it not out of place that I should make known to you the motives and principles by which my command will be governed.
We believe that every State that has been admitted as a slave State into the Union, since the adoption of the Constitution, has been so admitted in direct violation of that Constitution.
We believe that the slave States which existed as such at the adoption of our Constitution are, by becoming parties to that compact, under the highest obligations of honor and morality to abolish slavery. 
It is our conviction that monopolies are as destructive as competition is conservative of the principles and vitalities of Republican government; that slave labor is a monopoly which excludes free labor and competition; that slaves are kept in comparative idleness and ease in a fertile half of our arable territory, while free, white laborers, constantly augmenting in numbers from Europe, are confined to the other half, and are often distressed by want; that the free labor of the North has more need of expansion into the Southern States from which it is virtually excluded, than slavery had into Texas in 1846; that free labor is essential to free institutions; that those institutions are naturally better adapted and more congenial to the Anglo-Saxon race than are the despotic tendencies of slavery; and finally, that the dominant political principles of this North American continent, so long as the Caucasian race continues to flow in upon us from Europe, must needs be that of free institutions and free government. Any obstructions to the progress of that forming government in the United States must inevitably be attended with discord and war.
Slavery, from the condition of a universally recognized social and moral evil, has become at length a political institution demanding a political recognition. It demands rights to the exclusion and annihilation of those rights which are insured to us by the Constitution; and we must choose between them which we will have, for we cannot have both. The Constitution was made for free men, not for slaves. Slavery as a social evil might, for a time, be tolerated and endured; but as a political institution, it becomes imperious and exacting, controlling like a dread necessity all whom circumstances have compelled to live under its sway, hampering their action, and thus impeding our national progress.
As a political institution, it could exist as a coordinate part only of two forms of government, in the despotic and the free, and it could exist under a free government only when public sentiment, in the most unrestricted exercise of a robust freedom, leading to extravagance and licentiousness, had swayed the thoughts and habits of the people beyond the bounds and limits of their own moderate constitutional provisions. It could exist under a free government only when the people in a period of unreasoning extravagance had permitted popular clamor to overcome public reason, and had attempted the impossibility of setting up permanently, as a political institution, a social evil which is opposed to moral law.
By reverting to the history of the past, we find that one of the most destructive wars on record, that of the French Revolution, was originated by the attempt to give political character to an institution which was not susceptible of political character. The church, by being endowed with political power, with its convents, its schools, its immense landed wealth, its associations, secret and open, became the ruling power of the State, and thus occasioned a war of more strife and bloodshed, probably, than any other war which has desolated the earth.
Slavery is still less susceptible of political character than was the church; it is as fit at this moment for the lumber room of the past as was in 1793 the monastery, the landed wealth, the exclusive privilege, etc., of the Catholic Church in France.
It behooves us to consider, as a self-governing people, bred, and reared, and protected in the habits of self-government, whether we cannot, whether we ought not to revolutionize slavery out of existence, without the necessity of a conflict of arms, like that of the French Revolution.
Indeed, we feel assured that the moment slavery is abolished, from that moment our Southern brethren, every ten of whom have probably seven relatives in the North, would begin to emerge from a hateful delirium. From that moment, relieved from imaginary terrors, their days become happy, and their nights peaceable and free from alarm; the aggregate amount of labor under the new stimulus of fair competition becomes greater day by day; property rises in value; invigorating influences succeed to stagnation, degeneracy and decay; and union, harmony and peace, to which we have so long been strangers, become restored, and bind us again in the bands of friendship and amity as when we first be
<c05>
gan our national career under our glorious government of 1789.
Why do the leaders of the rebellion seek to change the form of our ancient government? It is because the growth of the African element of your population has come at length to render a change necessary! Will you permit the free government under which you have thus far lived, and which is so well suited to the development of true manhood, to be altered to a belitting despotism, in order to adapt it to the necessities of ignorant slaves and the requirements of their proud, aristocratic owners? Will the laboring men of the South bend their necks to the same yoke that is united to the slave? We think not. We may safely answer that the time has not yet arrived when our Southern brethren, for the mere sake of keeping Africans in slavery, will abandon their long cherished free institutions, and enslave themselves.
It is the conviction of my command, as a part of the national forces of the United States, that labor, manual labor, is inherently noble; that it cannot be systematically degraded by any nation without ruining its peace, happiness and power; that free labor is the granite basis on which free institutions must rest; that it is the right, the capital, the inheritance, the hope of the poor man everywhere; that it is especially the right of five millions of our fellow-countrymen in the slave States, as well as the four millions of Africans there; and all our efforts, therefore, however small or great, whether directed against the interference of governments from abroad, or against rebellious combinations at home, shall be for free labor.
Our motto and our standard shall be, here and everywhere, and on all occasions-Free Labor and Workingmen's Rights. It is on this basis, and this basis alone, that our magnificent government, the asylum of the nations, can be perpetuated and preserved. J. W. PHELPS, 
Brig. Gen. of Volunteers Commanding.
The proclamation has not yet been sent over to the Secessia, but Gen. Phelps proposes to promulgate it there as soon as he can obtain conveyance.
THE HERALD AND PUBLIC MEETINGS.
"It is understood," said The Herald of a, .day or two ago, alluding to the lecture of Mr. Wendell Phillips, advertised to be delivered this evening, "that he intends to pitch into the American Government, and praise that of England in relation to the Trent business.'' We presume that paper will follow up this lie to-day by others just as absurd and just as <illiegible>
great or small, by which it may help its friends, the Secessionists. It has a forlorn hope that there is yet force enough in the name " Abolitionist " to conjure a mob by. By a mob it will hold out aid and comfort to rebels; by a mob it hopes to concentrate all the treason of the city; out of one mob it hopes may grow many, and out of many mobs a continued state of riot when there may be again a chance of securing the triumph of traitors and of taking New York out of the Union. It uses the name of Phillips only as an incentive to disorder, that treason may make some headway.
It may be that there are a few persons-they can- not be many, notwithstanding the large number of its readers who buy the sheet, not because they care what it says, but because they think their neighbors do-it may be that there are still a few persons under the influence of a journal whose suppression, were its power at all commensurate with its circulation, would be more imperatively called for than the taking of any Southern city. Let such persons remember the record of the Herald for only a little more than half a year. It is a Secession sheet of the most malignant type. It advocated the adoption of the Secession Constitution only about eight months ago. That Constitution it declared to be "AN IMPROVEMENT" upon the Constitution adopted by our Fathers in 1789. It declared it to be " especially necessary that the conservative masses of this metropolis should take the lead in indorsing the Constitution which the Confederate States of the South have adopted, and of SIGNIFYING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ACQUIESCE IN THE SAME." All these facts we have stated before, and more than once, and never yet has the Herald ventured to say that it has changed its opinions. It is silent under the repeated charges made against it, by this and other journals, of its treason. It Dare not enter upon its defence. Reckless and bold as it is, it knows that there is a point where public patience will bear and forbear no longer; where even its unparalleled insolence as the great public Zany, the privileged Fool of the public press, who is tolerated because he raises a laugh, will not save it; it is wise enough to know that, if it claims any virtue, or disclaims any vice, and asks that its character be considered seriously, it is ruined from that moment. Therefore it dare not answer when arraigned for treason. A traitor everybody knows it is, and for its life it will not venture to assume that it is of any consequence whether it is or not It is ruined if it pretends to any character. It contents itself with being the mouth-piece of the vilest and most ignorant, satisfied that through such instrumentalities it may sometimes perpetrate the mischief it always longs for.
It is for this reason that the Herald, when peculiarly devilish, endeavors to get up a public meeting, or to incite a riot in one got up by other people. It wants a riot now at Mr. Phillips's lecture, in the interest of Secession, just as at the fall of Sumter it endeavored to get up a public meeting in opposition to the Government, and in sympathy with the South, that the attack upon Sumter might be made the occasion of the Secession of New York City, as it had proposed and urged for weeks before. We know that it is denied that the Herald ever made a call for such a meeting. We do not know whether the denial is made because it is hoped that nobody will take the trouble to verify the fact, or whether steps were taken, in the suppression of an edition of the paper, to make it difficult to verify it; but this we do know, that in the number for Monday, April 15, 1861, now before us, in an article on the fall of Sumter, the Herald says: " We again call upon our fellow citizens of this island, irrespective of creed or party, to meet together in an earnest consultation upon the ways and means of peace. The Government may yet recoil before them." In the same article it says, by way of creating a panic, and bringing out the vilest and most violent elements to rule such a meeting-" We fear that there is something more than empty bravado in the late speech of the Southern Secretary of War at Montgomery, promising the occupation of the City of Washington by the Confederate Stales authorities VERY EARLY IN MAY." This, be it remembered, was when the Federal flag lay trailing in the dust in Fort Sumter, shot down by Rebels, on Monday, the 15th of April, 1861. " Where," said the same paper, the day before, on Sunday, the 14th, in allusion to the same
Terrible affair that so shook this nation-�where is our Christianity, our civilization, our beautiful system of States and sections late united and happy? All involved in a horrid civil war. Where is this to

"I lay this down as the law of nations. I may that military authority takes, for the time, the places of all municipal institutions, and SLAVERY AMONG THE BEST; and that, under that state of things, so far from its being true that the States where slavery exists have the exclusive management of the subject, not only the PRESSIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, but the COMMANDER of the ARMY HAS POWER TO ORDER THE UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION OF THE SLAVES. From the instant that the slaveholding States become the theatre of a war, civil, servile, or foreign, from that instant the war powers of CONGRESS extend to interferences with the institution of slavery, IN EVERY WAY IN WHICH IT CAN BE INTERFEARD WITH, from a claim of indemnity for slaves taken or destroyed, to the cession of States, burned with slavery, to a foreign power it is a war power. I may it is a war power; and when your country is actually in war, whether it be a war of invasion or a war of insurrection, Congress has power to carry on the war, and MUST CARRY IT ON, ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF WAR; and by the laws of war, an invaded country has all its laws and municipal institutions swept by the board, and MARTIAL POWER TAKES THE PLACE OF THEM. When two hostile armies are set in martial array, the commanders of both armies have power to emancipate all the slaves in the invaded territory."-J. Q. ADAMS.
End? In a republician system like that of Mexico and Central and South America, or in an imperial Government like that of Russia or Louis Napoleon? Who can answer?� Such was the Herald�s estimate of the character of the American people-that they are incapable of self-government, and must sink into anarchy. Or unfit for it, and must, therefore, be brought under a despotism. So it called loudly, the next day, for a public meeting, which it hoped would compel the Government to �RECOLL� from defending its honor and the property of the nation. Had such a meeting been held the Herald would have called upon its constituents, the mob, to take possession of it, and use it on behalf of Jeff.Davis and his fellow-conspirators, just as he calls upon the same class now, and for the same reason,to mob Mr.Phillips-New York Tribute.

SECRETARY SMITH
If the saying of the Hon. Mr Smith, Secretary of the Interior, at the prentice banquet, are correctly reported, there is not much to choose between him and his predecessor, the Hon.Mr.Thomson. The following is the dispatch referring to the banquet and Mr.Smith:-
�WASHIGNTON,Nov.20,1861.
�At the supper to George D Prentice by Mr.Forney last night, Secretary Cameron reiterated his opinion that, as a last resort, we ought to arm every man who desires to strike for human liberty. Secretary Smith protested that Administration contemplated no such policy. Slaves escaping from the rebels might be received as they had been hitherto with the lines of the army, but it was not intended to arm them. If twenty millions of freemen could not, single-handed, subdue the rebellion, it would be a disgrace to them, and they ought to give up the contest.�
So, then, Mr.Smith would rather see the Union destroyed than permit a loyal negro to strike for human liberty! It is certainly amazing that a State which has poured out so much blood, and won such high distinction in this war as Indiana-a State which has evinced such devotion to the Union cause should be represented in the Cabinet by a man who is more concerned about the �rights� of rebel slaveholders than he is for the success of the loyal arms. Some time after the battle of Bull Run, where Secretary Cameron�s brother was slain,and,we believe,after the battle of Wilson�s Creek, where the glorious Lyon fell,Secretary Smith went up to New England and made a strong pro-slavery speech. He seemed to be laboring under the impression that John Tyler�s one-horse Congress, where he humbled himself and his constituents, was still grinding away <illiegible>somehow mortgaged to the same <illiegible>which he then took. We, in common with ninetenths of the Republicans in the Northwest, thought that President Lincoln greatly erred when he invited Mr.Smith instead of Mr. Colfax to a seat in his Cabinet; and now we know it
Let us see what is the practical operation of Mr.Smith�s policy. We have waged war eight months in strict accordance with his principles, and what have we gained? Big Bethel. Bull Run, Wilson�s Creek,Lexington, and Ball�s Bluff! True, we have achieved a success at Port Royal, but it is a success which promises happy results only by the application of Secretary Cameron�s principles. Secretary Smith would turn all its fruits into Dead Sea apples. According to his plan of conducting the war, we ought to make it as bloody and expensive as possible on our own side, rather than strike a decisive blow at the cause of the war, slavery. Four millions of negroes, whose inclinations are shown to be loyal wherever our armies go, are driven, coerced, flogged into the service of the rebels. Their labor feeds the rebel army. They constitute as essential a part of the forces arrayed against the Union as Jeff.Davis, his cabinet, his Congress, his Generals, and his soldiers, or all combined. To meet these forces we hav3e collected an army and navy of 550,000 men, and have gone into an expense of a million dollars per day. If we simply detach the slave population from the rebel service, we shall reduce their available strength one half, which would be equivalent to adding a quarter of a million of soldiers to our own side, or subtracting a half million of dollard perdiem from our expenses. But if we adopt Secretary Cameron�s plan, and put a musket into the hand of every man who will strike for Union and liberty, the rebellion will crumble of its weight and weakness. Mr. Smith would make the war long,. Bloody and costly, and peculiarly dangerous, in order to preserve slavery. Mr. Cameron, and those who think with him, would have it short, decisive and economical, causing no more bloodshed to the loyal soldiers, and bringing no more desolation to loyal households, than absolutely necessary to accomplish the end. Finally, Mr.Smith would give up the whole contest, and see the fabric reared by GeorgeWashignton shatted in ruins, rather than strike down the accursed institution which Washington in his last will and testament reprobated, and which has brought war and desolation upon the country which calls him its father-Chicago Tribune.

A PROSORIPT.
In his recent letter to Fernando Wood, Caleb Cushing proclaims himself �a prescript for opinion�s sake.� This attempt at securing a martyr,s claim for sympathy is worthy the impudence and unserupulousness of the man. Caleb Cushinga proscrfipt! The man who but a few weeks before he penned those lines had been chosen a member of the Legislature of Massachusetts by the suffrages of his towns men; the man who has contrived during the greater part of his life to keep in the majority, and who has shared freely in the honors of the parties to which he has belonged; the man who has been an Abolifionist, a Whig, and a Breekinridge Democrat, and is now trying to play the patriot, and seeking in vain to secure the confidence of the people whose sentiments he has so long bitterly opposed, whom he has so grossly abused and insulted for holding opinions different from his own! The very claim shows that the man is unworthy of the confidence he seeks to inspire; that his retirement to private life, however reluctant on his part, is a deserved retribution for his reckless and unprincipled political course.
A prescript! The theory of our government, in fact, of all governments is , that the majority must rule; that is, that the principles and views entertained by the greatest number in regard to political topics, must characterize the action of the government. The minority may not like it , but they must submit. Their only recourse is to change public sentiment, and to bring the majority over to their side. Where there is a division of sentiment, there must be minority, and this minority must not expect that it shall control affairs. Its members may be able and patriotic men, but they must remain in private life simply because they do not represent the predominant opinion. But for there to complain of being prescripts is as aboard as it mean, cowardly and contemptible. In the alternate strife of parties, the prominent men of all must be confined to private

ife, and excluded from public station. They are very apt, of course, to think the country is going to the dogs, but some how or other the world gets along, and it is found that the progress of human events is very little dependent on individuals for its success.
Caleb Cunning is now in the position of the men upon whom he has delighted to heap odium, and whom he has virulently misrepresented for so many Years. The anti-slavery men of the country have long been "proscripts" according to Mr. Cushing's definition. They have enjoyed no office: they have been treated with malignity and contempt by those who are now in treason against the nation and their sympathizers. But they have kept their souls in patience. They have labored year after year to effect a change in public opinion. They have not sought by revolution and treason to attain their ends, but have relied on free discussion and the influence of arguments addressed to the reason for ultimate success. At length they have succeeded. The reins of government have been placed in their hands. And ever since the democrats, especially those who have held fat offices, have been whining about "proscription," and complaining because they were at length compelled to vacate the pleasant places they have so long enjoyed. Such conduct deprives them of all claims to sympathy. Their complaint is entirely false in point of fact, and it stirs our contempt to see men raising such lamentations over the loss of places. We have respect for one who bears defeat manfully, but only contempt for those who do nothing but whine and lament.
It is worth noticing that Caleb's idea of "proscription" is precisely the same as that on which the Southern rebellion is founded. The South has long controlled the government. Those who have been in the minority have peaceably submitted. But the moment the tables were turned, the South raises the cry of "proscription." It is excluded, it says, from its share in the administration of the government. It knows that the opinion that has brought about this change renders it hopeless that slavery shall ever again be the controlling power of the American republic. Not acknowledging the duty of the minority to submit, a duty and a practice, the violation of which is inconsistent with any established government, it takes up arms and seeks to overthrow the government which it can no longer administer. This is the legitimate result of the carrying out of this doctrine of proscription. Caleb Cushing shows, by enunciating it, that his principles and his sympathies are entirely with the rebels of the slave States, and that he is unworthy of the slightest confidence or respect on the part of the people of the free States.-New Bedford Standard.

ELECTION OF MR. OPDYKE TO THE MAYORALTY OF NEW YORK.
As a Republican triumph, Mr. Opdyke's election has some importance, though not as significant as might have been wished. Still it is no unimportant thing for the reformers to have an opportunity of showing the value of their policy and principles by actual experiment, and in contrast with those of their opponents. Mr. Opdyke, in answer to the attack made on him by the New-York Herald, that he was an abolitionist of the Greeley, Cheever and Garrison stamp, said he was not an abolitionist, but that his opinions were correctly set forth by Judge Cowles at the ratification meeting. Though regretting that he should feel called upon to make this disavowal, we were somewhat relieved on referring to the Judge's speech. In it he remarks that although we are not fighting for the direct purpose of emancipating the slaves, he believed in using all the powers of the government and all the means it can command. He would use the slaves as quickly as he would use any other possession of the rebels; would properly wrest the slave from their hands, and use him to sustain and uphold our government:-
"What-when this unholy war shall have been brought to a close, and rebellion been made to hide its head in dishonor and in shame-what shall then be the condition of the slave who has helped to fight the battle of constitutional liberty, may be safely left, if government so decrees, to be determined by the exigency of then passing events. That such a slave will be rendered back against his will to bondage, neither George Opdyke, nor you, nor I believe. (Enthusiastic and prolonged applause. �Can't do it.') The inexorable logic of circumstances-the eternal laws of equity and justice, would forbid it. These are the views of George Opdyke. They are the views which he believes must be accepted and acted upon by our government whether it is prepared or not to announce them now. Nothing less than man this is just to our <illegible> and devoted army, or just to the slave. (Applause.) We would wage no war of emancipation as such, or for that sole object. But while and as long as this rebellion rages, we will wrest from the rebels slaves used and employed for the promotion of treason, and use them, if need be, as fighting defenders of constitutional liberty. (Great applause.) If, in thus using the slave to suppress treason, the necessary or inevitable subsequent result shall prove to be that slave's future freedom, treason, not loyalty, will be answerable for the result. The motto of our candidate through this war will be: �Live the Republic, though slavery perish' (applause); but never that other sentiment, which seems to run through the late speech of his competitor: 'Live slavery, though the Republic perish.' "
This utterance from the lips of Abraham Lincoln would set the nation in an ecstacy of delight, and alter the whole policy of the war; would instantly restore Gen. Fremont to his rightful field, the western department, and empty Missouri of traitorous hordes. This sentiment from the lips of Congress and the Commander-in-Chief would have set every slave in the rebel States free, and given us a jubilee more glorious than was ever known in Jewish history; the double jubilee of a rebellion crushed, four millions of slaves forever freed, and a nation saved. This sentiment, now finding utterance in Congress and in the order of Secretary Seward to Gen. McClellan, inspires our hopes and fires our devotion to liberty and our land. May Mr. Opdyke never retract these sentiments, and show that he is no farther removed from the abolitionists.-American Baptist.

THE ABOLITIONISTS AND THE REBELS.
Some say, the Abolitionists are as much to blame as the rebels. It is true, they have been for years warning the nation to put away her sins; without friends of freedom, there would be no opposition-of course not. This was the language of the Scribes and Pharisees of old; a pestilent fellow, a son of discord; away with him! crucify him! he it is that stirs up this trouble! What they said was true. If there had been no Jesus, there would have been no fuss at that time. Jesus and his agitating disciples were as necessary to stir up the row, as Judas and the chief priests; one is as famous as the other: yet history ascribes their deeds to very different motives. By their fruits ye may know which to follow. Massachusetts, the hot-bed of Abolitionism, is the abode of the most intelligent, freest, happiest, and noblest men and women on the earth. Nowhere else are life, property, and personal security, so perfect.
South Carolina, the most perfect specimen of the Slave Power, where no Abolitionists have ever been produced, is, on the contrary, the abode of the vilest, most turbulent, meanest, and most effeminate race in America.-Old Soldier's Advocate, Cleveland.

LOYAL SLAVEHOLDERS.
Great sacrifices must be made for their benefit; they are all-important in the eyes of many. Now, why should a slaveholder�s property be any more sacred than a freeman's property? Every farm and every other species of property must suffer by this war; why not let its disadvantages and burthens fall on slaveholders just as much as others? But where will you find a thorough loyal slaveholder? We have heard of hen's teeth and of white blackbirds, but we never could conceive of any man sustaining and aiding a system calculated to make men tyrants, und yet be a true friend to a Government based upon universal freedom. Our Government has sent thousands of arms to Kentucky and Missouri for the loyal citizens to defend themselves with; it is now well known that at least three-quarters of these very arms are in the hands of secessionists. Loyal slaveholders? Heaven save us from them! Every voluntary slaveholder will pitch where he can make the most out of his slaves. Such are like young hungry turkeys. Who has not observed a flock of loyal turkeys light on a fence, and observe with care to see on which side were the most grasshoppers? Oh, what loyalty!-Old Soldier�s Advocate.
Gen. Fremont has at length found a competent defender. Philip Dorsheimer, Jr., a member of his staff, is to prepare a series of papers for the Atlantic Monthly, giving a full history of the Missouri campaign. Mr. Dorsheimer is a writer of <illegible>ability, and personally conversant with Gen. Fremont's course in Missouri.

The Liberator.
BOSTON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 27, 1861.
NOTICE TO DELINQUENT SUBSCRIBERS.
Though by the terms of the Liberator, payment for the paper should be made in advance, yet it has not only not been insisted upon, but an indulgence of thirteen months has hitherto been granted delinquent subscribers, before proceeding (always, of course, with great reluctance) to erase their names from the subscription list, in accordance with the STANDING RULE laid down by the Financial Committee. But, in consequence of the generally depressed state of business, this indulgence will be extended from January 1, 1861, to April 1, 1862, in cases of necessity.

SEND IN THE PETITIONS!
Now that Congress is in session, and various propositions have already been submitted to it on the subject, let there be no unnecessary delay in forwarding emancipation petitions to that body. Send them directly to the proper Senators and Representatives from the various States and Districts. They will, of course, go free of postage. Already, large numbers, numerously signed, from various parts of the country, have been presented in both houses of Congress, and promptly referred to appropriate committees. The aggregate promises to be commanding. Send them in!
A petition for emancipation has been received at this office, headed by C. M. ALLEN, without the name of the town from which it came. Will any one give us the residence of the signers?

THE WAR.
LECTURE BY WENDELL PHILLIPS, ESQ.
AT THE COOPER INSTITUTE, NEW YORK.
The large hall of the Cooper Institute, New York, was crowded on Thursday evening of last week, to listen to a lecture on the Rebellion by Wendell Phillips, of Boston. The rumors which had been afloat in the city-propagated by those who at heart favor the Rebels in their nefarious attempt at disrupting the Government-that a riot would ensue upon the appearance of Mr. Phillips, put the police upon their guard, and a strong deputation, under the supervision of Superintendent Kennedy, was within the body of the hall to quell any symptoms of disturbance. They were conspicuous at the entrances and in different parts of the hall. Two powerful metropolitans stood on the platform on each side of the speaker, and Mr. Kennedy, the superintendent of police, sat at one side.
Oliver Johnson called the meeting to order, and announced that Theodore Tilton would lecture in that hall on the next Wednesday evening, and that Wm. Lloyd Garrison, of Boston, would soon be invited to give the public his views of the war in this place- (Cries of "Bravo," and applause.)
Dr. H. A. Hartt, of Dr. Cheever's church, introduced the speaker as follows:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: Wendell Phillips of Boston is a national man, and needs no introduction or eulogy from me. For more than a quarter of a century, he has stood up before the country as an able and eloquent expounder of great ethical principles. Unconnected with Church or State, yet a Christian and a patriot, he has devoted himself to the advocacy of the natural, political, and religious rights of man. [Applause.] Without commission from the nation, or authority from any ecclesiastical court, yet announced by God and inspired by his spirit, he has proclaimed essential, fundamental and eternal truths, which accredited priests and sages have repudiated and despised. Gifted with genius and fortune, and all the aids by which he might easily have attained the highest positions and offices in the nation, he has deliberately chosen to identify himself with the cause of a poor,<illegible> knew that, by inevitable consequence, he would become an object of incessant persecution and reproach. In an age of materialism, in the midst of a popular sentiment which insisted upon the toleration and support of a cruel and infamous system of oppression, he has had the courage to be the steady champion of the inherent worth and dignity of man; to place him in his true position, infinitely above all considerations of commerce, policy, Unions, Constitutions and Governments, and to demand for him the recognition of his inalienable rights. In the spirit of that divine affirmation, that "the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath," he has maintained that Government was made for man, and not man for Government. (Cheers.) He appears here now, as ever, the brilliant orator, to cast around the cause of justice and humanity the clearness of more than Grecian eloquence; now, as ever, for man and his rights above the Union and above the Constitution; but now, as never before, for the Union and the Constitution, (loud applause,) because he believes that out of the terrible ordeal through which they are passing, they shall come forth purified from every stain, and thenceforth and forever be for man and his rights. (Cheers.)
WENDELL PHILLIPS came on the stage amid loud applause, and when he rose, was received with three cheers. He said:-
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,-It would be impossible for me fitly to thank you for this welcome; you will allow me, therefore, not to attempt it, but to avail myself of your patience to speak to you, as I have been invited to do, upon the war.
I know, ladies and gentlemen, that actions-deeds, not words-are the fitting duty of the hour. Yet, still, cannon think in this day of ours, and it is only by putting thought behind arms that we render them worthy, in any degree, of the civilization of the nineteenth century. (Applause.) Besides, the Government has two-thirds of a million of soldiers, and it has ships sufficient for its purpose. The only question seems to be, what the Government is to do with these forces; in what path and how far it shall tread. You and I come here to-night, not to criticise, not to find fault with the Cabinet. We come here to recognize the fact, that in moments like these, the statesmanship of the Cabinet is but a pine shingle upon the rapids of Niagara, borne which way the great popular heart and the national purpose direct. It is in vain now, with these scenes about us, in this crisis, to endeavor to create public opinion; too late now to educate twenty millions of people. Our object now is to concentrate and to manifest, to make evident and to make intense, the matured purpose of the nation. We are to show the world, if it be indeed so, that democratic institutions are strong enough for such an hour as this. Very terrible as is the conspiracy, momentous as is the peril, Democracy welcomes the struggle, (applause,) confident that she stands like no delicately-poised throne in the old world, but, like the pyramid, on its broadest base, able to be patient with national evils,-generously patient with the long forbearance of three generations,-and strong enough when, after that they reveal themselves in their own inevitable and hideous proportions, to pronounce and execute the unanimous verdict-Death! (Sensation.)
Now, gentlemen, it is in such a spirit, with such a purpose, that I come before you to-night to sustain this war. Whence came this war? You and I need not curiously investigate. While Mr. Everett on one side, and Mr. Sumner on the other, agree, you and I may take for granted the opinion of two such opposite statesmen-the result of the common sense of this side of the water and the other-that Slavery is the root of this war. (Applause.) I know some men have loved to trace it to disappointed ambition, to the success of the Republican party, convincing 300,000 nobles at the South, who have hitherto furnished us the most of the Presidents, Generals, Judges and Ambassadors we needed, that they would have leave to stay at home, and that twenty millions of Northerners would take their share in public affairs. I do not think that cause equal to the result. Other
<c03>
men before Jefferson Davis and Governor Wise have been disappointed of the Presidency. Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and Stephen A. Douglas were more than once disappointed, and yet who believes that either of these great men could have armed the North to avenge his wrongs? Why, then, should these pigmies of the South be able to do what the giants I have named could never achieve? (Applause.) Simply because there is a radical difference between the two sections, and that difference is slavery. A party victory may have been the occasion of this outbreak. So a tea chest was the occasion of the Revolution, and it went to the bottom of Boston harbor on the night of the 16th of December, 1773; but that tea chest was not the cause of the Revolution, neither is Jefferson Davis the cause of the rebellion. (Applause and laughter.) If you will look upon the map, and notice that every slave State has joined or tried to join the rebellion, and no free State has done so, I think you will not doubt substantially the origin of this convulsion.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, you know me-those of you who know me at all-simply as an Abolitionist. I am proud and glad that you should have known me as such. (Applause.) In the twenty-five years that are gone-I say it with no wish to offend any man before me-but in the quarter of a century that has passed, I could find no place where an American could stand with decent self-respect, except in constant, uncontrollable and loud protest against the sin of his native land. (Applause.) But, ladies and gentlemen, do not imagine that I come here to-night to speak simply and exclusively as an Abolitionist. My interest in this war, simply and exclusively as an Abolitionist, is about as much gone as yours in a novel when the hero has won the lady, and the marriage has been comfortably celebrated in the last chapter. (Laughter and applause.) I know the danger of political prophecy,-a kaleidoscope of which not even a Yankee can guess the next combination,-but for all that, I venture to offer my opinion, that on this continent, the system of domestic slavery has received its death-blow. (Loud and long-continued applause.) Let me tell you why I think so. Leaving out of view war with England, which I do not expect, there are but three paths out of this war. One is, the North conquers; the other is, the South conquers; and the third is, a compromise. Now, if the North conquers, or there be a compromise, one or the other of two things must come-either the old Constitution or a new one. I believe that, so far as the slavery clauses of the Constitution of '89 are concerned, it is dead. It seems to me impossible that the thrifty and pains-taking North, after keeping 600,000 men idle for two or three years, at the cost of two million dollars a day; after that flag lowered at Sumter; after Baker and Lyon and Ellsworth and Winthrop and Putnam and Wesselhoeft have given their lives to quell the rebellion; after our Massachusetts boys, hurrying from ploughed field and workshop to save the Capitol, have been foully murdered on the pavements of Baltimore,-I cannot believe in a North so lost, so craven, as to put back Slavery where it stood on the 4th of March last. (Cheers.) But if there be reconstruction without those slave clauses, then in a little while, longer or shorter, Slavery dies-indeed, on any other basis but the basis of '89, she has nothing else now to do but to die. On the contrary, if the South-no, I cannot say conquers; my lips will not form that word-but if she balk us of victory, the only way she can do it is to write Emancipation on her own banner, and thus bribe the friends of liberty in Europe to allow its aristocrats and traders to divide the majestic Republic whose growth and trade they fear and envy. Either way, the slave goes free. Unless England flings her fleets along the coast, the South can never spring into separate existence, except from the basis of negro freedom; and I, for one, cannot yet believe that the North will consent again to share his chains. Exclusively as an Abolitionist, therefore, I have little more interest in this war than the frontiersman's wife had in his struggle with the bear, when she didn't care which, whipped (Laughter and applause.) But before I leave the Abolitionists, let me say one word. Some men say we are the cause of this war. Gentlemen, you do us too much honor! (Cheers and laughter.) If it be so, we have reason to be proud of it; for in my heart, as an American, I believe this year the most glorious of the Republic since '76. (Great applause.) The North, craven and contented until now, like Mammon, saw nothing even in heaven but the golden pavement; to-day she throws off her chains. We have a North, as Daniel Webster said. This is no epoch for nations to blush at. England might blush, in 1620, when Englishmen trembled at a fool's frown, and were silent when James forbade them to think; but not in 1649, when an outraged people cut off his son's head. Massachusetts might have blushed a year or two ago when an insolent Virginian, standing on Bunker Hill, insulted the Commonwealth, and then dragged her citizens to Washington to tell him what they knew about John Brown; but she has no reason to blush to-day when she holds that same impudent Senator an acknowledged felon in her prison fort. (Uproarious applause.) In my view, the bloodiest war ever waged is infinitely better than the happiest slavery that ever fattened men into obedience. (Cheers.) And yet I love peace. But it is real peace; not peace such as we have had; not peace that meant lynch law in the Carolinas and mob law in New York; not peace that meant chains around Boston Court-House, a gag on the lips of statesmen, and the slave sobbing himself to sleep in curses. No more such peace for me; no peace that is not born of justice, and does not recognize the rights of every race and every man. (Loud cheering.)
Some men say they would view this war as white men. I condescend to no such narrowness. I view it as an American citizen, proud to be the citizen of an empire that knows neither black nor white, neither Saxon nor Indian, but holds an equal sceptre over all. (Loud cheers.) If I am to love my country, it must be lovable; if I am to honor it, it must be worthy of respect. What is the function God gives us-what is the breadth of responsibility he lays upon us? An empire, the home of every race, every creed, every tongue, to whose citizens is committed, if not the only, then the grandest system of pure self-government. DeTocqueville tells us that all nations and all ages tend with inevitable certainty to this result, but he points out, as history does, this land as the Normal School of the Nations; set by God to try the experiment of popular education and popular government, to smooth all obstacles, discover all dangers, guard against all perils, facilitate the progress, help forward the hopes and the steps of the race. Let us see to it, that with such a crisis and such a past, neither the ignorance, nor the heedlessness, nor the cowardice of Americans forfeits this high honor, won for us by the toils of two generations, given to us by the blessing of Providence. It is as a citizen of the leading State of this Western continent, vast in territory, and yet its territory nothing compared with the grandeur of its past and the majesty of its future-it is as such a citizen, that I wish for one to find my duty, express as an individual my opinion, and aid thereby the Cabinet in doing its duty under such responsibility. It does not lie in one man to ruin us, nor in one man to save us, nor in a dozen. It lies in the twenty millions, in the thirty millions, of thirty-four States.
Now, how do we stand? In a war-not only that, but a terrific war-not a war sprung from the caprice of a woman, the spite of a priest, the flickering ambition of a prince, as wars usually have; but a war inevitable; in one sense, nobody's fault; the inevitable result of past training, the conflict of ideas, millions of people grappling each others' throats, every soldier in each camp certain that he is fighting for an idea that holds, the salvation of the world-every drop of his blood in earnest. Such a war finds no parallel nearer than that of the Catholic and Huguenot of France, or than that of Aristocrat and Republican in 1790, or of Cromwell and the Irish, when victory meant extermination. Such, is our war. I look upon it as the commencement of the great struggle between the bidden aris-
<c04>
tocracy and the democracy of America. You are to say to-day whether it shall last ten years or seventy, as it usually has done. It resembles closely that struggle between aristocrat and democrat which began in France in 1790, and continues still. While it lasts, it will have the same effect on the nation as that war between the blind loyalty, represented by the Stuart family, and the free spirit of the English Constitution, which lasted from 1660 to 1760, and made England a second-rate power almost all that century.
Such is the era on which you are entering. I will not speak of war in itself-I have no time; I will not say with Napoleon that it is the practice of barbarians; I will not say that it is good. It is better than the past. A thing may be better, and yet not good. This war is better than the past, but there is not an element of good in it. I mean, there is nothing in it that we might not have gotten better, fuller and more perfectly in other ways. And yet it is better than the craven past, infinitely better than a peace which had pride for its father and subserviency for its mother. Neither will I speak of the cost of war, although you know that we never shall get out of this one without a debt of at least two or three thousand millions of dollars. For, if the prevalent theory prove correct, and the country comes together again on any thing like the old basis, we pay Jeff Davis's debts as well as our own. Neither will I remind you that debt is the fatal disease of Republics, the first thing and the mightiest to undermine Government and corrupt the people. The great debt of England has kept her back in civil progress at least a hundred years. Neither will I remind you that when we go out of this war, we go out with an immense disbanded army, an intense military spirit embodied in two-thirds of a million of soldiers, the fruitful, the inevitable source of fresh debts and new wars; I pass by all that; yet lying within those causes are things enough to make the most sanguine friends of free institutions tremble for our future. I pass those by. But let me remind you of another tendency of the time. You know, for instance, that the writ of habeas corpus, by which Government is bound to render a reason to the Judiciary before it lays its hands upon a citizen, has been called the high-water mark of English liberty. The present Napoleon, in his treatise on the English Constitution, calls it the gem of English institutions. Lieber says that habeas corpus, free meetings like this, and a free press, are the three elements which distinguish liberty from despotism. All that Saxon blood has gained in the battles and toils of two hundred years are these three things. But to-day, Mr. Chairman, every one of them-habeas corpus, the right of free meeting and a free press-is annihilated in every square mile of the Republic. We live to-day, every one of us, under martial law. The Secretary of State puts into his bastile, with a warrant as irresponsible as that of Louis, any man whom he pleases. And you know that neither press nor lips may venture to arraign the Government without being silenced. At this moment one thousand men, at least, are "bastiled" by an authority as despotic as that of Louis-three times as many as Eldon and George III. seized when they trembled for his throne. Mark me, I am not complaining. I do not say it is not necessary. It is necessary to do anything to save the ship. (Applause.) It is necessary to throw everything overboard in order that we may float. It is a mere question whether you prefer the despotism of Washington or that of Richmond. I prefer that of Washington. (Loud applause.) But, nevertheless, I point out to you this tendency because it is momentous in its significance. We are tending with rapid strides, you say inevitably-I do not deny it; necessarily-I do not question it; we are tending toward that strong Government which frightened Jefferson, toward that unlimited debt, that endless army. We have already those alien and sedition laws which, in 1798, wrecked the Federal party, and summoned the Democratic into existence. For the first time on this continent, we have passports, which even Louis Napoleon pronounces useless and odious. For the first time in our history, Government spies frequent our great cities. And this model of <illegible> Government, if you reconstruct it on the old basis, is to be handed into the keeping of whom? If you compromise it by reconstruction, to whom are you to give these delicate and grave powers? To compromisers? Reconstruct this Government, and for twenty years you can never elect a Republican. Presidents must be so wholly without character or principle, that two angry parties, each hopeless of success, contemptuously tolerate them as neutrals. Now, I am not exaggerating the moment. I can parallel it entirely. It is the same position that England held in the times of Eldon and Fox, when Holcroft and Montgomery, the poet, Home Tooke and Frost and Hardy went into dungeons, under laws that Pitt executed, and Burke praised-times when Fox said he despaired of English liberty but for the power of insurrection-times which Sydney Smith said he remembered when no man was entitled to an opinion who had not �3,000 a year.  Why! there is no right-do I exaggerate when I say that there is no single right-that Government is scrupulous and finds itself able to protect, except the right of a man to slaves! (Laughter.) Every other right has fallen, now before the necessities of the hour.
Understand me, I do not complain of this state of things; but it is momentous. I only ask you that out of this peril you be sure to get something worthy of the crisis through which you have passed. No Government of free make could stand three such trials as this. I only paint you the picture, in order, like Hotspur, to say, "Out of this nettle, danger, be you right eminently sure that you pluck the flower, safety." (Applause.) Standing in such a crisis, certainly it commands us that we should endeavor to find the root of the difficulty, and that now, once for all, we should put it beyond the possibility of troubling our peace again. We cannot afford, as Republicans, to run this risk. The vessel of state-her timbers are strained beyond almost the possibility of surviving. The tempest is one which it demands the wariest pilot to outlive. We cannot afford, thus warned, to omit anything which can save this ship of state from a second danger of the kind.
Well, what shall we do? The answer to that question comes partly from what we think has been the cause of this convulsion. Some men think-some of your editors think-many of ours, too-that this war is nothing but the disappointment of one or two thousand angered politicians, who have persuaded eight millions of Southerners, against their convictions, to take up arms and rush to the battle-field-no great compliment to Southern sense. (Laughter.) They think that if the Federal army could only appear in the midst of this demented mass, the eight millions will find out for the first time in their lives that they have got souls of their own, tell us so, and then we shall all be piloted back, float back, drift back into the good old times of Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan. (Laughter.) Well, there is a measure of truth in that. I believe that if a year ago, when the thing first showed itself, Jefferson Davis, and Toombs, and Keitt, and Wise, and the rest, had been hung for traitors at Washington, and a couple of frigates anchored at Charleston, another couple in Savannah, and half a dozen in New Orleans, with orders to shell the cities on the first note of resistance, there never would have been this outbreak- (applause)-or it would have been postponed at least a dozen years; and if that interval had been used to get rid of slavery, we never should have heard of the convulsion. But you know we had nothing of the kind, and the consequence is, what? Why, the bewildered North has been summoned by every defeat, and every success, from its workshops and its factories, to gaze with half-opened eyes at the lurid heavens, until at last, divided, be. wildered, confounded, as this 20,000,000 were, we have all of us fused into one idea, that the Union meant Justice-shall mean Justice-owns down to the Gulf, and we will have it. (Applause.) Well, what has taken place meanwhile at the South? Why, the same thing. The divided, bewildered South has been summoned also out of her divisions by every success and every defeat, (and she has had more of the first than we have,) and the consequences is that she, too, is
<c05>
fused into a swelling sea of State pride, Northern hate-
"Unconquerable will,
And study of revenge, immortal hate, 
And courage never to submit nor yield."
She is in earnest, every man, and she is as unanimous as the Colonies were in the Revolution.-In fact, the South recognizes more intelligibly than we do the necessities of her position. I do not consider this a secession. It is no secession. I agree with Bishop General Polk-it is a conspiracy, not a secession. There is no wish, no intention, to go peaceably and permanently off. It is a conspiracy to make the Government do the will and accept the policy of the slaveholders. Its root is at the South, but it has many a branch in Wall street and in State street. (Cheers.) It is a conspiracy, and on the one side is every man who still thinks that he that steals a brother is a gentleman, and he that makes his living is not. (Applause.) It is the aristocratic element which survived the Constitution, which our fathers thought could be left under it, and the South to-day is forced into this war by the natural growth of the antagonistic principle. You may pledge whatever submission and patience of Southern institutions you please, it is not enough. South Carolina said to Massachusetts in 1835, when Edward Everett was Governor, "Abolish free speech-it is a nuisance." She is right-from her stand-point it is. (Laughter.) That is, it is not possible to preserve the quiet of South Carolina consistently with free speech: but you know the story Walter Scott told of the Scotch laird, who said to his old butler," Jock, you and I can't live under this roof." "And where does your honor think of going?" So free speech says to South Carolina to-day. Now I say, you may pledge, compromise, guarantee what you please. The South knows it is not your purpose-it is your character that she dreads. It is the nature of Northern institutions, the perilous freedom of discussion, the flavor of our ideas, the sight of our growth, the very neighborhood of such States, that constitutes the danger. It is like the two vases launched on the stormy sea. The iron said to the crockery, "I won't come near." "Thank you, thank you," said the weaker vessel; "there is as much danger in my coming near you." This the South feels; hence her determination; hence, indeed, the imperious necessity, that she should rule and shape our Government, or of sailing out of it. I do not mean that she plans to take possession of the North, and choose our Northern Mayors, though she has done that in Boston for the last dozen years, and here till this fall. But she conspires and aims to control just so much of our policy, trade, offices, presses, pulpits, cities, as is sufficient to ensure the undisturbed existence of slavery. She conspires with the full intent so to mould this Government as to keep it what it has been for thirty years, according to John Quincy Adams-a plot for the extension and perpetuation of slavery. As the world advances, fresh guarantees are demanded. The nineteenth century requires sterner gags than the eighteenth. Often as the peace of Virginia is in danger, you must be willing that a Virginia Mason shall drag your citizens to Washington, and imprison them at his pleasure. So long as Carolina needs it, you must submit that your ships be searched for dangerous passengers, and every Northern man lynched. No more Kansas rebellions. It is a conflict between the two powers, Aristocracy and Democracy, which shall hold this belt of the continent. You may live here, New York men, but it must be in submission to such rules as the quiet of Carolina requires. That is the meaning of the oft-repeated threat to call the roll of one's slaves on Bunker Hill and dictate peace in Faneuil Hall. Now, in that fight, I go for the North, for the Union.
In order to make out this theory of "irrepressible conflict," it is not necessary to suppose that every Southerner hates every Northerner, (as the Atlantic urges.) But this much is true: some 300,000 slaveholders at the South, holding two thousand millions of so-called property in their hands, controlling <illegible> of poor whites into being their tools, into believing their interest is opposed to ours-this order of nobles, this privileged class, has been able for forty years to keep the Government in dread, dictate terms by threatening disunion, bring us to its verge at least twice, and now almost to break the Union in pieces. A power thus consolidated, which has existed seventy years, setting up and pulling down parties, controlling the policy of the Government, and changing our religion, and is emboldened by uniform success, will not burst like a bubble in an hour. For all practical purposes, it is safe to speak of it as the South: no other South exists, or will exist, till our policy develops it into being. This is what I mean. An Aristocracy rooted in wealth, with its net-work spread over all social life, its poison penetrating every fibre of society, is the hardest possible evil to destroy. Its one influence, FASHION, is often able to mock at Religion, Trade, Literature and Politics combined. One half the reason why Washington has been and is in peril-why every move is revealed and checkmated -is, that your President is unfashionable, and Mrs. Jefferson Davis is not. Unseen chains are sometimes stronger than those of iron, and heavier than those of gold.
It is not in the plots, it is in the inevitable character of the Northern States that the South sees her danger. And the struggle is between these two ideas. Our fathers, as I said, thought they could be left, one to outgrow the other. They took gunpowder, and a lighted match, forced them into a stalwart cannon, screwed down the muzzle, and thought they could secure peace. But it has resulted differently: the cannon has exploded, and we stand among fragments.
Now, some Republicans and some Democrats-not Butler, and Bryant, and Cochrane, and Cameron-not Boutwell, and Bancroft, and Dickinson, and others-but the old set (laughter)-the old set say to the Republicans, "Lay the pieces carefully together in their places; put the gunpowder and the match in again (laughter); say the Constitution backward instead of your prayers, and there will never be another rebellion!" (Cheers and laughter.) Now, I doubt it (Cheers.) It seems to me that like causes will produce like effects. If the reason of the war is because we are two nations, then the cure must be to make us one nation, to remove that cause which divides us, to make our institutions homogeneous. If it were possible to subjugate the South and leave slavery where it is, where is the security that we should not have another war in ten years? Indeed, such a course invites another war, whenever demagogues please. I believe the policy of reconstruction is impossible. And if it were possible, it would be the greatest mistake that Northern men could commit-(Cheers.) Peace with an unchanged Constitution would leave us to stand like Mexico, States married not matched; chained together, not melted into one; foreign nations aware of our hostility, and interfering to embroil, rob and control us. We should be what Greece was under the intrigues of Philip, and Germany when Louis XIV. was in fact her dictator. We may see our likeness in Austria, every fretful province an addition of weakness; in Italy, twenty years ago, a leash of angry hounds. A Union with unwilling and subjugated States, smarting with defeat, and yet holding the powerful and dangerous element of slavery in it, and an army disbanded into laborers, food for constant disturbance, would be a standing invitation to France and England to insult and dictate, to thwart our policy, demand changes in our laws, and trample on us continually.
Reconstruction is but another name for the submission of the North. It is her subjection under a mask. It is nothing but the confession of defeat. Every merchant, in such case, puts every thing he has at the bidding of Wigfall and Toombs in every cross-road bar-room at the South, For, you see, never till now did anybody but a few Abolitionists believe that this nation could be <illegible> one section against the other in arms. But the secret is out. The weak point is discovered. Why does the London press 
<c06>
lecture us like a schoolmaster his seven-years-old boy? Why does England use a tone such as she has not used for half a century to any power? Because she knows us as she knows Mexico, as all Europe knows Austria,-that we have the cancer concealed in our very vitals. Slavery left where it is, after having created such a war as this, would leave our commerce and all our foreign relations at the mercy of any Keitt, Wigfall, Wise or Toombs. Any demagogue has only to stir up a pro-slavery crusade, point back to the safe experiment of 1861, and lash the passions of the aristocrats to cover the sea with privateers, put in jeopardy the trade of twenty States, plunge the country into millions of debt send our stocks down fifty per cent., and cost thousands of lives. Reconstruction is but making chronic what now is transient. What that is, this week shows. What that is, we learn from the tone England dares to assume toward this divided Republic. I do not believe reconstruction possible. I do not believe the cabinet intend it. True, I should care little if they did, since I believe the Administration can no more resist the progress of events than a spear of grass can retard the step of an avalanche. But if they do, allow me to say, for one, that every dollar spent in this war is worse than wasted, every life lost is a public murder and that any statesman who leads these States back to reconstruction will be damned to an infamy compared with which Arnold was a saint, and James Buchanan a public benefactor. (Slight disturbance in the rear part of the hall, cries of "Put him out," &c.) I said reconstruction is not possible. I do not believe it is, for this reason: the moment these States begin to appear victorious, the moment our armies do anything that evinces final success, the wily statesmanship and unconquerable hate of the South will write "Emancipation" on her banner, and welcome the protectorate of a European power. And if you read the European papers of today, you need not doubt that they will have it. Intelligent men agree that the North stands better with Palmerston for minister than she would with any minister likely to succeed him. And who is Palmerston? While he was Foreign Secretary, from 1848 to'51, the British press ridiculed every effort of the French Republicans-sneered at Cavaignae and Ledru Rollin, Lamartine and Hugo-while they cheered Napoleon on to his usurpation, and Lord Normanshy, then minister at Paris, the 3d of December grasped the hand still wet with the best blood of France, congratulating the Despot on his victory over the Reds, applying to the friends of Liberty the worst epithet that an Englishman knows. This last outrage lost Palmerston his place; but he rules to-day-though rebuked, not changed.
The value of the English news this week is the indication of the nation's mind. No one doubts now that should the South emancipate, England would make haste to recognize and help her. In ordinary times, the government and aristocracy of England dread American example. They may well admire and envy the strength of our Government, when, instead of England's impressments and pinched levies, patriotism marshals six hundred thousand volunteers in six months. The English merchant is jealous of our growth: only the liberal middle classes really sympathize with us. When the other two classes are divided, this middle class rules. But now, Herod and Pilate are agreed. The aristocrat, who usually despises a trader, whether of Manchester or Liverpool. as the South does a negro, now is secessionist from sympathy as the trader is from interest. Such a union, no middle class can checkmate. The only danger of war with England is, that as soon as England declared war with us, she would recognize the Southern Confederacy, immediately, just as she stands, slavery and all, as a military measure. As such, in the heat of passion, in the smoke of war, the English people, all of them, would allow such a recognition even of a slaveholding empire. Indeed, the only way, the only sure way, to break this Union, is to try to save it by protecting slavery "Every <illegible> as Napoleon said, "is an opportunity for misfortune'' Even if we have no war with England, let another eight or ten months be as little successful as the last, and Europe will acknowledge the Southern Confederacy, slavery and all, as a matter of course. War with England ensures disunion. When England declares war, she gives slavery a fresh lease of fifty years. Further, any approach toward victory on our part, without freeing the slave, gives him free to Davis. So far, the South is sure to succeed, either by victory or defeat, unless we anticipate her. We shall never conquer the South without her trying emancipation. Do you suppose that Davis, and Beau-regard, and the rest, mean to be exiles, wandering contemned in every great city of Europe, in order that they may maintain slavery and the Constitution of'89? They, like ourselves, will throw everything overboard before they will submit to defeat-defeat from Yankees. I do not believe, therefore, that reconciliation is possible, nor do I believe the Cabinet have any such hopes. Indeed, I do not know where you will find the evidence of any purpose in the Administration at Washington. (Hisses, cheers, and laughter.) If we look to the West, if we look to the Potomac, what is the policy? If, on the Potomac, with the aid of twenty Governors, you assemble an army, and do nothing but return fugitive slaves, that proves you competent and efficient. If, on the banks of the Mississippi, unaided, the magic of your presence summons an army into existence, and you drive your enemy before you a hundred miles further than your second in command thought it possible for you to advance, that proves you incompetent, and entitles your second in command to succeed you. (Tremendous applause, and three cheers for Fremont.)
Looking in another direction, you see the Government announcing a policy in South Carolina. What is it? Well, Mr. Secretary Cameron says to the General in command there, "You are to welcome into your camp all comers; you are to organize them into squads and companies; use them in any way you please, hut there is to be no general arming." that is a very significant exception. You recollect in Charles Reade's novel, Never too Late to Mend, (a very good motto,) the heroine flies away to hide from the hero, announcing that she never shall see him again. Her letter says, "I will never see you again, Edward. You, of course, won't come to see me at Mrs. Young's at No. 126 Bond street, (laughter,) between 11 in the morning and 4 in the afternoon, because I shan't see you." (Laughter.) So Mr., Cameron says there is to be no general arming, but I suppose there is no be a very particular arming. (Laughter.) But he goes on to add, This is no greater interference with the institutions of South Carolina than is necessary, than the war will cure. Does be mean he will give slaves back when the war is over? I don't know. All I know is, that the Port Royal expedition proved one thing-it laid forever that ghost of an argument, that the blacks loved their masters-it settled forever the question whether me were with us or with the South. My opinion is, that the blacks are the key of our position. (A voice-"That is it-") He that gets them wins, and he that loses them goes to the wall. (Applause.) Port Royal settled one thing-the blacks are with us, and not with the South. I know nothing more touching in history, nothing that art will immortalize and poetry dwell upon more fondly-I know no tribute to the Stars and Stripes more impressive, than that incident of the blacks coming to the water slue with little bundles, in that simple faith which had endured through the long night of so many bitter years. They preferred to be shot rather than be driven from the sight of that banner they had so long prayed to see. And if that was the result when nothing but General Sherman's equivocal proclamation was lined on the Carolinas, what should we have seen, if sere had been 18,000 veterans with FREMONT, the statesman soldier of to war, at their head, (loud applause.) and over them the Stars and Stripes, gorgeous with the motto, "Freedom for all, freedom forever"? If that had had gone before them, in my opinion they would have marched across the Carolinas, and joined

Brownlow in East Tennessee. (Applause.) The bulwark on each side of them would have been 100,000 grateful blacks; they would have cut this rebellion in halves, and while our fleets fired salutes across New Orleans, Beauregard would have been ground to powder between the upper millstone of McClellan, and the lower of a quarter million of blacks rising to greet the Stars and Stripes. (Great cheering.) McClellan may drill a better army-more perfect soldiers. He will never marshal a stronger force than those grateful thousands. That is the way to save insurrection. He is an enemy to civil liberty, the worst enemy to his own land, who asks for such delay, or perversion of government policy, as is sure to result in insurrection. Our duty is to save these four millions of blacks from their own passions, from their own confusion, and eight millions of whites from the consequences of it, (�Hear, hear!") and in order to do it, we nineteen millions of educated, Christian Americans are not to wait for the will or the wisdom of a single man-we are not to wait for Fremont or McClellan-the Government is our dictator. It might do for Rome, a herd of beggars and soldiers, kept quiet only by the weight of despotism-it might do for Rome, in moments of danger, to hurl all responsibility into the hands of a dictator. But for us, educated, thoughtful men, with institutions modelled and matured by the experience of two hundred years-it is not for us to evade responsibility by deferring to a single man. I demand of the Government a policy. I demand of the Government to show the doubting infidels of Europe that Democracy is not only strong enough for the trial, but that she breeds men with brains large enough to comprehend the hour, and wills hot enough to fuse the purpose of nineteen millions of people into one decisive blow for safety and for Union. (Cheers.) You will ask me how it is to be done. I would have it done by Congress. We have the power.
When Congress declares war, says John Quincy Adams, Congress has all the powers incident to carrying on war. It is not an unconstitutional power; it is a power conferred by the Constitution; but the moment it comes into play, it rises beyond the limit of Constitutional checks. I know it is a grave power, this trusting the Government with despotism. But what is the use of government, except just to help us in critical times? All the checks and ingenuity of our institutions are arranged to secure for us men wise and able enough to be trusted with grave powers-bold enough to use them when the times require. Lancets and knives are dangerous instruments. The use of surgeons is, that when lancets are needed, somebody may know how to use them, and save life. One great merit of democratic institutions is, that resting, as they must, on educated masses, the government may safely be trusted, in a great emergency, with despotic power, without fear of harm, or of wrecking the State. No other form of government can venture such confidence without risk of national ruin. Doubtless the war power is a very grave power; so are some ordinary peace powers. It was a grave power in 1807, in time of peace, when Congress abolished commerce; when, by the embargo of Jefferson, no ship could quit New York or Boston; and Congress set no limit to the prohibition. It annihilated commerce. New England asked, "Is it constitutional ?� The Supreme Court said, "Yes.� New England sat down and obeyed. Her wharves were worthless, her ships rotted, her merchants beggared. She asked no compensation. The powers of Congress carried bankruptcy from New Haven to Portland; but the Supreme Court said, it is legal, and New England bowed her head. We commend the same cup to the Carolinas to-day. We say to her that, in order to save the Government, there resides somewhere despotism. It is in the war powers of Congress. That despotism can change the social arrangements of the Southern States, and has a right to do it. Every man of you who speaks of the emancipation of the negroes allows it would be decisive if it were used. You allow when it is a military necessity, we may use it. What I claim is, in honor of our institutions, that we are not put to wait for the wisdom or the courage of a General. Our fathers left us with no such miserable plan of government. They gave us a government with the power, in such times as these, of doing something that would save the helm of State in the hands of its citizens. (Cheers.) We could cede the Carolinas. I have sometimes wished we could shovel them into the Atlantic. (Applause and laughter.) We can cede a State. We can do anything for the time being; and no theory of government can deny its power to make the most unlimited change. The only alternative is this: Do you prefer the despotism of your own citizens, or of foreigners? That is the only question in war. (Cheers,)
Now, this Government, which abolishes my right of habeas corpus-which strikes down, because it is necessary, every Saxon bulwark of liberty-which proclaims martial law, and holds every dollar and every man at the will of the Cabinet-do you turn round and tell me that this same Government has no power to stretch its hands across the Potomac, and root up the evil which for seventy years has troubled its peace, and now culminates in rebellion? I maintain, therefore, the power of the Government itself to inaugurate a policy; and I say, in order to save the Union, do justice to the black. (Applause.)
I would claim of Congress,-in the exact language of Adams, of the �government,"-a solemn act abolishing slavery throughout the Union, securing compensation to loyal slaveholders. As the Constitution forbids the States to make and allow nobles, I would now, by equal authority, forbid them to make slaves or allow slaveholders.
This has been the usual course at such times. Nations, convulsed and broken by too powerful elements or institutions, have used the first moment of assured power,-the first moment that they clearly saw and fully appreciated the evil,-to cut up the dangerous tree by the roots. So, France expelled the Jesuits, and the Middle Ages the Templars. So, England in her great Rebellion abolished Nobility and Established Church; and the French Revolution gave to each child an equal share in his deceased father's lands. For the same purpose, England in 1745 abolished clanship in Scotland, the root of the Stuart faction; and we in '76 nobles and all tenure of estates savoring of privileged classes. Such a measure supplies the South just what she needs-capital. That sum which the North gives the loyal slaveholder, not as acknowledging his property in the slave, but a measure of conciliation,-perhaps an acknowledgment of its share of the guilt,-will call mills, ships, agriculture into being. The free negro will redeem to use lands-
(1) �Sir, in the authority given to Congress by the Constitution of the, United States to declare war, ALL THE POWERS INCIDENTAL TO WAR are, by necessary implication, conferred upon the GOVERNMENT of the United States. There are two classes of powers vested by the Constitution of the United States in their Congress and Executive government: the powers to be exercised in time of peace, and the powers incident to war. That the powers of peace are limited by provisions within the body of the Constitution itself; but that the powers of war are limited and regulated only by the laws and usages of nations, and are subject to no other limitation. I am not admit that there is, even among the peace powers of Congress, no such authority; but IN WAR, there are many ways by which CONGRESS NOT ONLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY, BUT ARE BOUND TO INTERFERE WITH THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY IN THE STATES. When the Southern States are the battlefield between Slavery and Emancipation, Congress may sustain the institution by war, or perhaps ABOLISH IT by treaties of peace; and they will not only possess the constitutional power so to interfere, but THEY WILL BE BOUND IN DUTY TO DO IT, by the express provisions of the Constitution itself. From the instant that the slaveholding States become the theatre of a war, civil, servile, or foreign, from that instant the war powers of Congress extend to interference with the institution of slavery, IN EVERY WAY BY WHICH IT CAN BE INTERFERED WITH. With a call to keep down slaves, in an insurrection and a civil war, comes a full and plenary power to this House and to the Senate over the whole subject. It is a war power. Whether it be a war of invasion or a war of insurrection, Congress has power to carry on the war, and must carry it on, according to the laws of war; and by the laws of war, an invaded country has all its laws and municipal institutions swept by the board, and martial law takes the place of them. This power in Congress has, perhaps, never been called into exercise under the present Constitution of the United States.�-[Speeches of John Quincy Adams in the U. S. House of Representatives, 1836-1842.
<c02>
never touched, whose fertility laughs Illinois to scorn, and finds no rival but Egypt. Such a measure binds the negro to us by the indissoluble tie of gratitude-the loyal slaveholder by strong self-interest-our bonds are all his property-the other whites, by prosperity, they are lifted in the scale of civilization and activity, educated and enriched. Our institutions are then homogeneous. We grapple the Union together with hooks of steel,-make it as lasting as the granite that underlies the continent.
People may say this is strange language for me-a Disunionist. Well, I was a Disunionist, sincerely, for twenty years. I did hate the Union, when Union meant lies in the pulpit and mobs in the street, when Union meant making white men hypocrites and black men slaves. (Cheers.) I did prefer purity to peace; I acknowledge it. The child of six generations of Puritans, knowing well the value of Union, I did prefer disunion to being the accomplice of tyrants. But now, when I see what the Union must mean, in order to last; when I see that you cannot hare Union, without meaning justice; and when I see twenty millions of people, with a current as swift and as inevitable as Niagara, determined that this Union shall mean justice, why should I object to it? (Loud applause.) I endeavored honestly, and am not ashamed of it, to take nineteen States out of this Union, and consecrate them to liberty; and twenty millions of people answer me back, "We like your motto, only we mean to keep thirty-four States under it." (Cheers.) Do you suppose I am not Yankee enough to buy Union when I can have it at a fair price? (Applause and laughter.) I know the value of Union; and the reason why I claim that Carolina has no right to secede is this; we are not a partnership; we are a marriage: and we have done a great many things since we were married in 1789 which render it unjust for a State to exercise the right of revolution, on any ground now alleged. I admit the right. I acknowledge the great principles of the Declaration of Independence, that a State exists for the liberty and happiness of the people, that these are the ends of government, and that when government ceases to promote those ends, the people have a right to remodel their institutions. I acknowledge the right of revolution in South Carolina; but at the same time, I acknowledge that right of revolution only when Government has ceased to promote those ends. Now we have been married for seventy years. We have bought Florida. We rounded the Union to the Gulf. We bought the Mississippi for commercial purposes. We bought Texas for slave purposes. Great commercial interests, great interests of peace have been sub-served by rounding the Union into a perfect shape; and the money and sacrifices of two generations have been given for this purpose. To break up that Union now is to defraud us of mutual advantages relating to peace, trade, national security, which cannot survive disunion. Why did we buy Texas? Why have we allowed the South to strengthen herself? Because she said that slavery within the girdle of the Constitution would die out through the influence of natural principles. She said: "We acknowledge it to be an evil; but at the same time it will end by the spread of free principles, and the influence of free institutions." And the North said: "Yes; we will give you privileges on that account, and we will return your slaves for you." Every slave sent back from a Northern State is a fresh oath of the South that she would not secede. Our fathers trusted to the promise that this race should be left under the influence of the Union, until in the maturity of time the day should arrive when they would be lifted into the sunlight of God's equality. I claim it of South Carolina. By virtue of that pledge, she took Boston, and put a rope around her neck in that infamous compromise which consigned to slavery Anthony Burns. I demand the fulfilment on her part even of that infamous pledge. Until South Carolina allows me all the influence that nineteen millions of Yankee lips, asking infinite questions, have upon the welfare of those four millions of bondmen, I deny her right to secede. (Applause.) Seventy years has the Union postponed the negro. For seventy years has he been beguiled with the promise, as she erected one bulwark after another around slavery, that he should have the influence of our common institutions. I claim it to-day. Never, with my consent, while the North thinks that the Union can or shall mean justice, shall those 400,000 South Carolina slaves go beyond the influence of Boston ideas. That is my strong reason for clinging to the Union. This is also one main reason why, unless upon most imperative and manifest grounds of need and right, South Carolina has no right of revolution; none till she fulfils her promise in this respect.
I know how we stand to-day, with the frowning cannon of the English fleet ready to be thrust out of the portholes against us. But I can answer England with a better answer than William H. Seward can write. I can answer her with a more statesmanlike paper than Simon Cameron can indite. I would answer her with the stars and stripes floating over Charleston and New Orleans, and the itinerant Cabinet of Richmond packing up archives and wearing apparel to move back to Montgomery. (Great applause.) There is one thing, and only one, that John Bull respects; and that is, success. (Applause.) It is not for us to give counsel to the Government on points of diplomatic propriety; but I suppose we may express our opinion, and my opinion is that if I were the President of these thirty-four States, while I was, I should want Mason and Slidell to stay with me. (Great laughter and applause.) I say then, first as a matter of justice to the slave, we owe it to him; the day of his deliverance has come. The long promise of seventy years is to be fulfilled. The South draws back from the pledge. The North is bound, in honor of the memory of her fathers, to demand its exact fulfilment, and in order to save this Union, which now means justice and peace, to recognize the rights of 4,000,000 of its victims. This is the dictate of Justice. Justice, which at this hour is craftier than Seward, more statesmanlike than Cameron; Justice, which appeals from the cabinets of Europe to the people; Justice, which abases the proud and lifts up the humble; Justice, which disarms England, saves the slaves from insurrection, and sends home the Confederate army of the Potomac to guard its own hearths; Justice, which gives us four million of friends, spies, soldiers in the enemy's country, planted each one at their very hearth-sides; Justice, which inscribes every cannon with "Holiness to the Lord," and puts a Northern heart behind every musket; Justice, which means victory now and peace for ever. To all cry of demagogues asking for boldness, I respond with the cry of "Justice, immediate, absolute Justice!" And if I dared to descend to a lower level, I should say to the merchants of this metropolis, demand of the Government a speedy settlement of this question. Every hour of delay is big with risk. Remember, as Gov. Boutwell suggests, that our present financial prosperity comes because we have corn to export in place of cotton; and that another year, should Europe have a good harvest, and we an ordinary one, while an inflated currency tempts extravagance and large imports, general bankruptcy stares us in the face. Do you love the Union? Do you really think that on the other side of the Potomac are the natural brothers and customers of the manufacturing ingenuity of the North? I tell you, certain as fate, God has written the safety of that relation in the same scroll with justice to the negro. The hour strikes. You may win him to your side; you may anticipate the South; you may save twelve millions of customers. Delay it, let God grant McClellan victory, let God grant the Stars and Stripes over New Orleans, and it is too late.
Jeff. Davis will then summon that same element to his side, and twelve millions of customers are added to Lancashire and Lyons. Then commences a war of tariffs, embittered by that other war of angered nationalities, which are to hand this and the other Confederacy down for twenty-five or thirty years, divided, weakened and bloody with intestine struggle. And what will be our character? I do not agree with Edward Everett, in that very able and eloquent address which he delivered in Boston, in which he said one thing worth his life-he, the compromiser-that if in 
<c03>
1830, 1831, nullification, under Jackson, had been hung, instead of compromised, we never should have had Jeff. Davis. (Loud applause.) I agree with him, and hope we shall make no second mistake of the kind. But I do not agree with him in the conclusion that these nineteen States left alone, would be of necessity a second-rate Power. No. I believe in brains, and I know these Northern men have more brains in their right hands than others have in their heads. (Laughter and cheers.) I know that we mix our soil with brains, and that, consequently, we are bound to conquer. Why, the waves of the ocean might as well rebel against our granite coast, or the wild bulls of the prairies against man, as either England or the South undertake to stop the march of the nineteen free States of this continent. (Applause.)
It is not power that we should lose, but it is character. How should we stand when Jeff. Davis had turned that corner upon us-abolished slavery, won European sympathy, and established his confederacy? Bankrupt in character-outwitted in statesmanship. Our record would be, as we entered the sisterhood of nations-"Longed and struggled and begged to be admitted into the partnership of tyrants, and they kicked them out!" And the South would spring into the same arena, written on her brow-"She got rid of what she thought gainful and honest, in order to gain her independence!" A record better than the gold of California, or all the brains of the Yankee.
Righteousness is preservation. You, who are not Abolitionists, do not come to this question as I did-from an interest in these four millions of black men. I came on this platform from sympathy with the negro. I acknowledge it. You come to this question from an idolatrous regard for the Constitution of '89. But here we stand. On the other side of the ocean is England, holding out, not I think a threat of war-I do not fear it-but holding out to the South the intimation of her willingness, if she will but change her garments, and make herself decent-(laughter)-to accept her under her care, and give her assistance and protection. There stands England, the most selfish and treacherous of modern Governments. (Loud and long-continued cheers.) On the other side of the Potomac stands a statesmanship, urged by personal and selfish interests, that cannot be matched, and between them they have but one object-it is in the end to divide the Union.
Hitherto the negro has been a hated question. The Union moved majestic on its path, and shut him out, eclipsing him from the sun of equality and happiness. He has changed his position to-day. He now stands between us and the sun of our safety and prosperity, and you and I are together on the same platform-the same plank-our object to save the institutions which our fathers planted. Save them in the service of justice, in the service of peace, in the service of liberty; and, in that service, demand of the Government at Washington that they shall mature and announce a purpose. That flag lowered at Sumter, that flight at Bull Run, will rankle in the heart of the Republic for centuries. Nothing will ever medicine that wound but the Government announcing to the world that it knows well whence came its trouble, and is determined to effect its cure, and, consecrating the banner to liberty, to plant it on the shores of the Gulf. (Great applause.) I say, in the service of the negro-but I do not forget the white man, the eight millions of poor whites, thinking themselves our enemies, but who are really our friends. Their interests are identical with our own. An Alabama slaveholder sitting with me a year or two ago, said:
�In our Northern counties they are your friends. A man owns one slave or two slaves, and he eats with him, and sleeps in the same room-(they have but one)-as much as your hired man eats at the table with you. There is no difference. They are too poor to send their sons North for education. They have no newspapers, and they know nothing but what they are told by us. If you could get at them, they would be on your side, but we mean you never shall."
In Paris, there are one hundred thousand men whom caricature or epigram can at any time raise to barricade the streets. Whose fault is it that such men exist? The Government's; and the government under which such a mass of ignorance exists deserves to be barricaded. So with the Government under which eight millions of people exist, so ignorant that two thousand politicians and a hundred thousand aristocrats can pervert them into rebellion, deserves to be rebelled against. In the service of those men I mean, for one, to try to fulfil the pledge my fathers made when they said, "We will guarantee to every State a republican form of government." (Applause.) A privileged class, grown strong by the help and forbearance of the North, plots the establishment of aristocratic government in form as well as essence,-conspires to rob the non-slaveholders of their civil rights. This is just the danger our national pledge was meant to meet. Our fathers' honor, national good faith, the cause of free institutions, the peace of the continent, bid us fulfil this pledge-insist in using the right it gives us to preserve the Union.
I mean to fulfil the pledge that free institutions shall be preserved in the several States, and I demand it of the Government. I would have them, therefore, announce to the world what they have never done yet. I do not wonder at the want of sympathy on the part of England with us. The South says, "I am fighting for slavery." The North says, "I am not fighting against it." Why should England interfere? The people have nothing on which to hang their sympathy.
I would have Government announce to the world that we understand the evil which has troubled our peace for seventy years; we know well its character. Democracy, unlike your governments, knows that it is strong enough to let evils work out their own death-strong enough to face them when they reveal their proportions. It was in this sublime consciousness of strength, not weakness, that our fathers recognized the admitted evil of slavery, and tolerated it until the viper we thought we could safely tread on, at the touch of disappointment, starts up a fiend reaching to the heavens; but our cheeks do not blanch. Democracy accepts the struggle. After this forbearance of three generations, confident that she has power yet to execute her will, she sends her proclamation down to the Gulf-Freedom to every man beneath the stars, and death to every institution that disturbs our peace, or that threatens the future of the Republic! (Applause.)

WAR WITH ENGLAND-ITS SPIRIT.
The Mexican war began and ended in the service of slavery. The North was dragged into it by Southern tyrants. In the sacred name of liberty-for the "extension of the area of freedom"-Mexico was dismembered, and robbed of the fairest portion of her dominions, at the instigation and in behalf of these unscrupulous wretches. This identical Slave Power, after the lapse of fifteen years, bent on the same ends, not only assumes the shape of rebellion against the most benign government on earth, but by every means within its reach, it seeks to involve us in another foreign war, in comparison with which the first was only pastime. By a union of the English navy with its own military strength, it aims to remove the only obstacle to its ambition, by the conquest of the free North. American self styled aristocracy rests on African slavery; English aristocracy on the over-taxed and over-governed industrious masses;-of different origin, but kindred in spirit and creed. All heaven was made for a few saints like themselves; the entrance to the same straight and narrow, because few go in thereat. Hell, broader and deeper, was designed for the mass of mankind, and its approach therefore is broad, and crowded with travellers. These few were created by express design of the Almighty to rule and ruin here, that they may be the more readily exalted there; but the great mass of mankind, the same Almighty designed to be trampled in the dust here, the better to be damned there. This is the creed of the despot, but he is careful not to formally record it in his books. Both English and Southern despotism hate the people, and while they rule down, they also 
<c04>
mean to rule out the American Republic, the great stumbling-block to the success of their inhuman plans.
Southern despotism, sometimes called "democracy," the growth of less than a century, is now on the brink of the grave. In its agony, it stretches out its arm over the sea, and begs its elder brother to snatch it into life. The proffer, so tempting, if accepted, may engulph them both in a common ruin. If so, let all the world say amen, and take courage!
It is not cotton, it is not corn, it is not the "music of the dollar's chink," just now, greedy as England is; it is not the infraction of international law. English aristocracy is the growth of centuries. Its all grasping ambition has by slow and steady pace won to itself power, wealth and renown. It takes no back tracks, but holds on. It yields only to superior force, never to the dictates of reason or justice. Slavery of the people is its corner-stone, with its accustomed ignorance and degradation, and so it hates all effort to restore mankind to its original, native rights, which come through freedom. It therefore hates American republicanism, because its great animating soul lies in respect for man as man; because it believes through culture to make the most of all rational human power. To the true Republican, or better, the true Democrat, or better still, the true Christian-all one and identical, when righty interpreted-all human beings, with all their powers and faculties, are held to be divine in origin and destiny.
On this continent, these principles have been planted. They have both taken root and germinated. In the soft air, amid the dew and rain from the sweet heavens, they are now pushing up into life to yield both leaf and fruit for the healing of the nations. All these and here, on this side the Atlantic, are now in course of experiment. It has its drawbacks, to be sure, but its march is onward. Tyrants across the water as well as at home know all this, and dread its power.
Slaveholding secessionists, then, it seems, and English aristocrats, do not like republics, and so they propose to enter into an alliance to put the free people of these United States down; and they mean to have at least nine millions of the black and white victims of the "institution," together with the great mass of the honest English people, misused and trodden upon-they mean to have their help.
Not so, say some. The English people are all right. They hate our slavery and love our liberty. They rejoice at our prosperity. True; but who and what are the people, without knowledge, and cheated and hoodwinked by tyrants? As well may the loyal men of the North say, the people in the South love the Union, and would fight for it if they could; but a handful of as arrant tyrants as ever cursed Greek or Jew use them only to abuse. Tyrants, with their minions, never fight for ideas. They are destructives ever. The one aspires to perpetual dominion-the other, witlessly to abridge its own freedom and to rivet its own chains.
Are we, then, through the rascally representations of lying emissaries in the pay of traitors, to be dragged into a war with England? We are; so says the English newspaper press, which, like our own, is daily introduced to the secrets of the Cabinet! And what is to be done to us? The blockade is to be broken, Northern ports are to be blockaded, the Southern Confederacy to be recognized, our naval and commercial marine is to be swept from the seas, we are to be threatened on the Northern frontier by English troops, and Southern armies are to overcome us and complete our destruction. All finished up, England is to be the mistress of the seas in a more emphatic sense than ever, a new empire, mighty and majestic, is to arise out of the South, with slavery for its cornerstone, and the North is to be held, it is presumed, as a conquered province. But it may be in this, as in other cases, that the war will hardly come up to the high-sounding phrase of the manifesto. Pray, what are we to be doing all this time? First of all, the rebellion will engage a more serious attention than hitherto. It must be no longer a mere boxing match with gloves. Not sods, but stones. To catch the "misguided brethren," and compel them, against their wills, to "swear a prayer or two," while they trample the Constitution under their feet, and then let them go, will not do. It is very expensive. It makes large tax bills. But there is a cheaper and better way than this. It is to strike rebellion under its fifth rib. This will be a quick remedy, and, if cautiously administered, not a violent one. England may then open or seal the ports hermetically, if she can; it is all the same to us. Not a bale of cotton or bushel of corn will she get by this process; and she may work at it ten years, if she can, while we make money by the operation. A few years' grass growing in our city thoroughfares would be a less evil than the extremes of wealth and poverty now so common, and we should have less occasion to contrast stupendous piles of brick and mortar-the erections, in too many cases, of a vulgar pride-with a multitude of starvelings, who can get no honest work. If in the end we are saddled with a national debt, we will bear it at least as well as the nations of Europe. If it is bad to be too far in debt, it is worse to be too far out and above-board. If the spendthrift and bankrupt are to be deprecated, so also should the meanly rich and selfish.
Blockade either the ports of the South or England, and they go to decay. The South lives by raising the raw cotton, England by its manufacture-nearly exclusive interests; and when the gates are closed through which they go to market over the sea, then they are powerless. Both powers are dependent on a large marine. Not so with the North. Foreign commerce is with us but comparatively an incident now, whatever it may once have been. The bulk of what comes water-borne to our shores, we could easily dispense with, and find ourselves healthier and wiser thereby. The seaboard would suffer, but the great interior would be stimulated to its highest productive capacity. Easy and cheap subsistence, and a rational degree of prosperity, would be open to all. Fortunately for us, if we are to have a foreign war, we have a diversity of callings, and find our true independence in our own abundant resources.
This is supposing the worst to happen to our seaports. No blockade, however, can be so effectual as to stop the egress of the privateer; in which case, where is English commerce? Nor can England stop the creation of a navy among us-and what then?
No one courts a foreign war at this juncture. At any time, it is but a sad and terrible necessity. The government and people will join hands in due apology if any government agent has unjustly clashed with the rights of a neighboring nation. They will be peaceably inclined, and open to conviction; but if, on a candid consideration, it should be felt that we have done no wrong, then should no threat or open declaration of war, even, deter us. But, come weal or woe in such a war, when all shall be over, it will take many generations to efface the conviction, that whether in the character of her present "neutrality," or by lending her power and influence to the base attempts of conspirators at the reconstruction of American society on a slave-basis, or by seizing the opportunity presented by our present embarrassments to strike a blow at the hopes of freedom and happiness not only of a single nation, but of mankind-England is not only mean, but criminally selfish.
In the next quarter of a century, if we are prosperous as in times past, there will be upwards of seventy millions of people here. This prospective greatness of a Republic, and that the first power among the nations, disturbs the dreams of John Bull. To become a whipstick in the hands of this wretched man-stealing traitor of the South is surely a great business for proud old England; another instance as foolish as it would be flagrant of "vaulting ambition overleaping itself.� W.
Though the tone of the English press is decidedly pugnacious, and the popular feeling there appears to be hot and blustering, and though Gen. Scott has suddenly returned home from France in the steamship Arago, yet we do not believe that England and America will come to blows on this question.

ESSEX COUNTY A. S. SOCIETY.
The Quarterly meeting of the Essex County Anti-Slavery Society was held at the Silsbee Street Chapel, Lynn, on the afternoon and evening of Sunday, Dec. 15th.
The meeting was called to order by the President, C. L. Remond. at half-past 2 o'clock. Prayer was offered by the Rev. Samuel Johnson, and a chapter from Joshua, pertinent to the times, was read by Mr. Garrison.
On motion of James N. Buffum, Esq., W. L. Garrison, Jr., was chosen Secretary pro tem, and a Finance Committee, consisting of Messrs. Buffum and Merrill, and Miss Maria Page, was appointed.
The President, in opening, referred to the past experience of the Society. Their work, which had been so valuable in the past, was by no means ended. Never were the efforts of anti-slavery men more needed than now. The times demanded earnest action. He closed by cordially inviting all to speak who should feel moved to.
The following resolutions were presented by Mr. Pillsbury:-
Resolved, That while we rejoice in all the assurances of the advancing state of public sentiment on the subject of Southern slavery, we still deem the mission of the Abolitionists unaccomplished, so long as a slave wears a chain, or a nominally free colored man is subjected to any proscription, political, educational, or ecclesiastical, on account of his complexion.
Resolved, That slavery is the sin and crime to-day, which it has ever been; and is the sin of the North as well as of the South; and the present fearful collision between the North and South is but a penalty for that sin, and a just retribution on the Northern States for long complicity in the greatest crime of all the ages-and without waiting for that meanest of all motives to emancipation, "A MILITARY NECESSITY," it is the duty of the North, both government and people, immediately to repent of the sin by blotting our slavery forever out of existence, as an act of justice, of humanity, and of obedience to God, whatever consequences might attend so sublime an act.
The meeting was then addressed, in an earnest and able manner, by William Lloyd Garrison and Parker Pillsbury, whose remarks were received with strong demonstrations of approval by a large audience.
In the evening, the chapel was again well filled with a deeply interested audience, and the same speakers again delivered highly impressive and stirring speeches, preceded by a brief but eloquent address by the President. It is believed that an excellent impression was made, favorable to the cause of immediate and universal emancipation. Many signatures were appended to the Anti-Slavery Memorial to Congress, and a collection of more than eighteen dollars taken up in aid of the cause.
CHARLES LENOX REMOND, President.
LYDIA M. TENNY, Secretary.

THE TWENTY EIGHTH
NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY SUBSCRIPTION ANNIVERSARY.
The time for the ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION ANNIVERSARY again draws nigh, and we look forward to it with pleasure, as the means of meeting familiar, friendly faces, and listening to earnest words of counsel and encouragement. Some say that other agencies are now in such active operation, that "the old Abolitionists," as they are called, can well afford to rest upon their oars, while others carry forward their work to its completion. We cannot view the subject in this light. Our mission is the same now that it was thirty years ago. Through many and strange changes, we have slowly but steadily advanced toward its fulfilment; but there are many indications that our work is not yet in a state to be safely left to other hands. We have been, and we must still be, a fire to warm the atmosphere of public opinion. More than a quarter of a century ago, the fire was kindled with generous zeal, and year after year it has been fed with untiring industry and patience. Not all the cold water that politicians, merchants, and ecclesiastical bodies could throw upon it has sufficed to extinguish the flame, or even to prevent it from spreading. The moral thermometer can never again fall to the old freezing point. In view of this, we thank God, and take courage. But who that observes passing events, and reflects upon their indications, can arrive at the conclusion that the fire is no longer needed?
It is true that blood and treasure are lavishly expended to put down a most wicked and sanguinary rebellion, the proclaimed purpose of which is to extend and perpetuate SLAVERY. But the government of the United States manifests, in every possible way, a vigilant carefulness to protect the claims of Slavery, and politicians are continually announcing that the war has nothing to do with the cause of the war. There are now very few slaveholders who condescend to profess allegiance to the government; yet, small as is the remnant of that powerful and unprincipled oligarchy, they still appear to govern the counsels of the nation. The honest expression of THE PEOPLE'S wishes is required to be suppressed, lest the utterance should prove offensive to this arrogant minority, so long accustomed to rule the majority. The people are full of generous enthusiasm for their country. If the polar star of a great idea were presented to them, they would follow it with eager courage through suffering and death. But it seems to be the aim of politicians to create a fog so dense that neither star nor sunlight shall glimmer through it to guide the millions, who are longing to be led in the right direction.
Is this a time to let the sacred fire smoulder on the altar of freedom? On the contrary, there has never been a time when it was more necessary to watch it with vigilance, and feed it with untiring activity.
We, Abolitionists, still have unwavering faith that "a straight line is always the shortest, in morals as well as in mathematics." Politicians are always in need of being convinced of this obvious truth; and they are peculiarly in need of it now. Let us, then, continue to work for the good old cause in every way that is consistent with our own conscientious convictions. Let us meet together, that our hearts may be cheered and our hands strengthened for whatsoever work the God of the oppressed may call upon us to do.
All those who have faith in the principles of freedom, all who believe that the effect of righteousness would be peace and security for our unhappy country, are cordially and earnestly invited to meet us at the usual time and place in Boston, in January next. [Particulars hereafter.]
Contributions, and expressions of sympathy, from friends at home or abroad, in person or by letter, will be most thankfully received; for we have great need of both at this most momentous and trying crisis.

THE INDEPENDENT, Rev. Dr. Bacon, Rev. J. P. Thompson, and Rev. Dr. Storrs have retired from the editorship of the Independent. They have edited the paper ever since it was started, thirteen years ago. Henry Ward Beecher is now to be its editor. Dr. Leavitt and Theodore Tilton still retain their editorial connections with the paper.
<c06>
We print this morning the lecture of Wendell Phillips on the war, delivered last evening in the Cooper Institute to an overflowing audience. In spite of the incendiary appeals of the Herald, the audience was one of the most orderly we have ever seen, and the sentiments of the speaker awakened such enthusiastic responses as were hardly to have been expected in the city of New York. Mr. Phillips regards the negro as the key of our position. Whichever side takes the negro by the hand will win in the contest. Justice eventually triumphs. If we do not free the blacks, and avail ourselves of their services, Jeff. Davis assuredly will achieve success and Southern independence.-New York Tribune, Dec. 20th.
The speech here referred to by the Tribune we give entire in our present number, as revised and corrected by Mr. Phillips. It has all that terseness of thought and expression, masterly ability, and rare eloquence, which so uniformly characterize Mr. P's public addresses, and will be read, of course, with absorbing interest. Its length necessarily excludes our usual variety of matter, and all details of the various military conflicts in Missouri and Kentucky, which in every instance have resulted in the discomfiture of the rebels.
A lady who left Savannah on the 24th ultimo, and whose statements are entitled to the fullest credit, says that there was the greatest terror in that city when the news of the Federal victory at Port Royal became known. Everybody ran off who could run, and every one carried as much as he or she could take. The lady says:-
"A number of the wealthiest citizens removed every valuable movable thing in their houses to some place in the country, and placed combustible material in the rooms, preparatory to firing them as soon as the Yankees landed. Cotton was sent inland as fast as it could be carried. But the Yankees did not land, no movement was made toward Savannah, and the senses of brave Southrons began to come back to them. They telegraphed to different points of their danger, and in a few days there were 17,000 troops in the city; the fort was reinforced, the batteries manned, new works of defence erected, and preparations made to give the Yankees a warm reception when they made their appearance. The women got over their fright, and after an absence of five days in the country, Miss A. returned with her friends to the city. The slaves of Savannah expressed very great fear of the Yankees, and ran away with the women and children, except such as were kept in town by their masters. At Beaufort, all the good slaves went away with the whites. Only the vicious ones remained in the place. One slave-owner, who made up his mind to leave Beaufort very suddenly, called all his slaves together, and asked how many of them would go with him. Out of over a hundred, but ten refused to go. He took them to the back yard, and deliberately shot every one of them."
GEN. HUNTER�S PLATTE COUNTY POLICY. A Committee of the citizens of Platte county, (Mo.) visited Gen. Hunter on Monday, the 2d. The General said to them: "Tell the Trustees of Platte county, that unless they give up Gordon and his gang, and break up every rebel camp, I shall send Colonel Jennison over there with orders to burn every house in the county. I am getting tired of the whole subject."
Committee-Will you put that in writing?�
Gen. Hunter-"I will."
That brief interview satisfied Platte county, and the policy indicated will satisfy Kansas and the country.-Chicago Tribune.
DETENTION OF REBELS CLAIMING SLAVES. General Heintzelman has within the past few weeks added to the population of Alexandria several Virginians whose desire to recover fugitive slaves outran their discretion. When they presented themselves at his headquarters in search of their lost bondsmen, he informed them that the soldiers of the National army were not slave catchers, and when, satisfied that he meant what he said, they essayed to return to their farms, he declared that he could not permit civilians to go beyond or to remain within his lines. One of them has, in consequence, been a month in Alexandria waiting for the army to advance to the other side of his plantation. "Dark-skinned Union men" continue to seek Gen. Heintzelman�s camp, but fewer rebel owners visit him.
CONGRESS. In the U. S. House of Representatives on Monday last-
Mr. Wilson's resolution requesting the Military Committee to report a bill for the enactment of an additional article of war, prohibiting officers in the military service of the United States using forces under their command for the return of fugitive slaves, was considered and passed; ayes 67, nays not counted. The punishment for violations is dismissal from service.
A communication was received from W. H. Lamon, Esq., Marshal of the District of Columbia, in answer to a resolution of that body requiring him to show by what authority he receives and retains slaves in the jail of this District.

THE SLAVE'S APPEAL TO THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.
Starry banner! waving free,
Over land and over sea,
Proudly o'er the world you wave,
Yet, beneath you sighs the slave!
Starry banner, wave for me,
Break the bonds of Slavery!
Lovely banner, floating high,
Thou hast heaven's own azure dye;
Shall thy that gleam so bright,
Leave me ever here in night?
Lovely banner, wave for me,
Light the night of Slavery!
Flag of unto thee
White men look, and boast they're free:
Must I still, in grief and pain,
Turn my eyes to thee in vain?
Starry banner, wave for me!
Break my chains, and set me free!
Starry banner! onward wave!
Float in mercy o'er the slave,
Till he, too, can look to thee,
And rejoice shat he is free!
Flag of Freedom! over me
Wave, and give me liberty!

ANGELS OF EARTH.
BY J. C. HAGEN.
There are angels, angels many
Even now upon the earth,
Dark as it may seem to any
Creature of celestial birth.
Though, while on their earthly mission,
They are robed in forms of clay,
To our spiritual vision
Brighter than the sun are they.
Tints the world could give then never,
Deck the wings on which they move;
For these angel ones are ever
Borne upon the wings of love.
'Mid earth's scenes of mirth and gladness
Look not for these forms of light;
Oft'ner, 'mid its gloom and sadness,
Will you see their faces bright.
Oft they seek the dwelling lonely
Of the world-deserted one,
Cheering homes the selfish only
Know of to avoid and shun;
Now in kindness ministering
To the needy and oppressed;
Now the dropping spirit cheering,
Giving to the weary rest;
Oft, the scoffer's voice unheeding,
Solacing the child of shame,
And her trembling footsteps leading
Back, her virtue to reclaim.
Often may you see them shaking
From the slave his galling chain,
And his torpid soul awaking
Unto life and strength again.
Of the dungeon, dread and fearful,
Oft the ponderous door they 
To the wretch, in accents cheerful,
Whispering courage, whispering hope;
O'er the couch of sickness 
When the leech's skill is vain,
Aid to fainting nature lending,
Giving life and health again;
Often at the death-bed kneeling,
In the fervency of prayer,
Heaven unto the soul revealing
That was sinking with despair;
Now, with godlike love, beseeching
Men to shun the fields of gore,
When unheeded all their preaching,
Healing up the wounds of war;
Childhood's guileless nature warning
From the path that lead astray;
Fitting manhood's early morning
For the labors of the day;
Ever toiling, ever striving
Man to teach his aim and worth,
And God's holy law 
Are these angels of the earth.
Shedding bitter tears of sorrow
O'er the ills they cannot stay,
Ever hoping for to-morrow
Something better than to-day.
Surely, when, their task completing,
They to better worlds shall fly,
They shall meet a friendly greeting
From their brethren in the sky.

A TRACT FOR OUR ARMY AND NAVY.
I'm beat! There, boys, I'II give it up,
This cursed trick of drinking!
I've nursed the devil long enough
For my own good, I'm thinking.
So, here goes BOTTLE, PIPE., CIGAR,
The vile confederation!
Hurrah, my boys, I'm strong enough
To beat the whole creation!
Come Jack, come Joe, come comrades all,
And quit your drunken capers;
This Mr. 
I tell you in these Papers.
He shows the thing up mighty smart-
 what's the very best 
It 's true Gospel, all he says,
Too true to make a jest on t.
I've served the devil, boys, you know,
In shape of PIPES and BRANDY,
Until he 's come to count on me
As something pretty handy.
I know the Cuss-why, man alive,
He wants 
TOBACCO, PIPES, TODDY.
I have a mother, boys, at home,
And, when I was a shaver,
She used to talk a deal to me
About my "good behavior."
I've made her old eyes water since;
But now, I'II tell you what, sir,
I'II make her cry on t' other side;
I'II be no more a sot, sir.
Then here goes SWEARING, RUM, CIGARS,
The whole vile crew together!
God helping me, I'II stiver through,
In spite of wind and weather.
Hark! there' s the drum! To arms, my boys!
The whole Confederation 
Can 't scare me now-I 'm strong enough
To conquer all creation!
WINTER.
Lo, Winter comes! and all his heralds blow
Their gusty trumpets, and his of snow
Usurp the fields from whence from whence sad Autumn flies-
Autumn, that finds a Southern clime, or dies.
The streams are dumb with woe; the forest grieves,
Wailing the loss of all its summer leaves;
As same fond Rachel on her childless breast
Clasps her thin hands where once her young were pressed,
Then flings her empty arms into the air,
And swells the gale with her convulsed despair.
THE ANTHEM OF FREEDOM.
Like some old organ-peal,
Solemn and grand,
The anthem of Freedom
Sweeps through the land.

PROPHETIC COMMUNICATION.
W. L. GARRISON:
DEAR FRIEND-The following prophetic communication, purporting to come from the spirit world, was written, at the period of its date, now about ten years since, a lady in Western New York, who, under similar influence, penned many beautiful and interesting articles, bearing the names of different individuals. Her mind and purported to be controlled by her who was an excellent man, and then about thirty years in the angel world, and without whose permission none others could access to her. She wrote with rapidity, though seeing but a word at a time, and could not tell, when a communication was finished, whether or not there was in it any connection of ideas. What was written was, of course, as new to her as to any one else. Its publication may not, perhaps, be without interest, as foreshadowing the solemn events which are now transpiring in our country, and as indicating the propitious results to which they are tending.
THOMAS MCCLINTOCK.
Philadelphia, 10th mo. 30th, 1861.
11th mo. 2d, 1851.
MY DAUGHTER-At the earnest desire of one who for his country contended while he inhabited the rudimental sphere, do I now announce to thee the presence of George Washington, who wishes to write a few thoughts.
THY FATHER.
"Woe, woe to America! A woe is pronounced against her from heaven. She hath forsaken her God. She hath bowed herself to Ambition and Avarice. She hath encompassed sea and land to make proselytes. She hath sought to enlarge her boundaries, and to be amongst the mighty of the earth. But the day of her humiliation is at hand. Her government shall be broken up. Her children shall rise in rebellion, and cause her to become a by-word and hissing among the nations of the earth. My soul goes out in mourning at her degeneracy. Better had she never been born to inherit the mal-organization of her parents. They saw but in part the beauty, the holiness of that perfect liberty which the children of light are called into, and hence transmitted to their posterity imperfection, whose giant growth now overspreads the land of my love.
O, America! the magnitude of thy errors is as a mountain piled up to heaven. It shall be shaken by the mighty power of God. It already totters to its base. It is swayed to and fro by the winds of heaven. Its volcanic elements will burst it asunder, and not a fragment shall be left. On its site then will be reared a structure of beauty, of goodness, fit for the children of purity to inhabit; for on its door-posts will be blazoned her motto of liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all. The seed of oppression will not be left within her portals to strike root and rear its gigantic head, sending forth poison to infect the land.
Then, all who dwell in the soil of freedom, from whence are to be dug the foundation stones on which this structure is to be built, cease not to exhume them from their resting places, in order that they may be ready when called for. Then will the earth approach the angel sphere, and they will descend with their influence to cause it to come forth clad in its robes of strength and power, to resist all opposing force."-[A Voice from Heaven, through George Washington.]
EMANCIPATION LEAGUE.
FRIEND GARRISON:
We have organized an Emancipation League here, and the following persons have been chosen its officer:-George Keely Radcliffe, President; Michael C. Teel and Oliver J. Gerrish, Vice Presidents; Edward Everett Emerson, Secretary; Charles H. Philbrick, Treasurer.
At a meeting held by this League on Saturday evening, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted, and ordered to be printed in the newspapers, particularly the Liberator, and Pine and Palm:-
Resolved, That in the recent death of FRANCIS Esq., of Boston, that city has lost one of its most upright, far-seeing, warm-hearted and noble-minded citizens, whose works follow him only in praise, and whom every good man should strive to emulate.
Resolved, That in the double capacity of President of one Anti-Slavery Society, and Treasurer of another, for a long series of years, he magnified and made honorable a noble cause, and discharged his duties in these, as well as in all other positions of trust, with marked efficiency, and without reproach. That we especially honor him for his fidelity to the slave, and his humanity toward all fugitives from the prison-house of bondage; and that we rejoice that, in his last will and testimony, this hunted and oppressed race were remembered, to his everlasting honor.
Resolved, That we rejoice further, that in his last will and testament, the pioneers of the Anti-Slavery cause were not forgotten; and we commend most heartily his example in this respect to all wealthy and philanthropic people who desire to animate and enlarge the sphere of usefulness of noble men and women, and secure to the rising generation a proper education in works of philanthropy to their fellow-men, however persecuted and degraded.
Resolved, That we sympathize kindly with the relatives and friends of the lamented deceased, and would fain inspire them to keep his memory ever green by words and deeds of charity and good-will to their fellows, without distinction of caste or color.
Resolved, That the sublime principle inaugurated by JOHN C. FREMONT, if carried out to the fullest extent, would have created the only policy by which armed traitors, marauders and pirates can be effectually conquered.
G. K. RADCLIFFE, President
Haverhill, Dec. 14, 1861.
We have associated ourselves together for the purpose of diffusing all the information possible pertinent to the crisis now upon us, and which we hope and trust will soon come to an end by the utter extinction of slavery, its undoubted cause. No other cure but Emancipation can be effectual; and we agree with you that colonization, as broached by the president, would only produce "fresh agitation and unending conflict." And we endorse, to the fullest extent, your very apt remark, that" President Lincoln may colonize himself, if he choose, but it is an impertinent act, on his part, to propose the getting rid of those who are as good as himself." No man who cares a "fig" for the Golden Rule or Declaration of Independence-who cares a "snap" for genuine Republicanism, Democracy or Christianity, can tolerate this scheme for a moment. Every friend to oppressed and persecuted humanity ought to flout and scout it, no matter from what source it comes. This hounding down an innocent and unfortunate to Theodore Parker, the most docile and affectionate race in the world, seems to us as cowardly as it is cruel. But I will not dwell upon the matter. Let me add, that we are utterly ashamed of the metropolis of this State in again electing Wightman as Mayor, a man who would be repudiated by Massachusetts for any office that might be named. And we have just about as much reason to be ashamed of the daily press of Boston. With the exception (not wholly, either,) of the Transcript and Traveller, no press in the United States is more heartless, mendacious and vacillating Is Boston never to be rid of such nuisances as the Courier and its mercenary and depraved panderers and backers? Let her be warned that the people of this Commonwealth never will honor any such "notions" as mobocratic mayors or prostituted presses. Mark that!
Allow me to say, in conclusion, that the officers of our League are all printers-steady and true men Documents sent to either with be gratefully received, read and pondered. "Circulating the truth" is one of our grand objects.
PENTUCKET.
<c03>SIDE GLANCES AT THE WAR.
"Watchman, what of the night? "How goes the 'conflict? Are we approaching the hour of emancipation, or are we rolling back into barbarism? Hope whispers, all will end well. God and Right will triumph.
"Though the mills of God grind slowly,
Yet they grind exceeding small-
Though with patience he stands waiting,
With exactness grinds he all."
But there are side glances, which fail not to amuse and profit the " looker-on in Venice." How rapidly we seem to be advancing towards common sense and decency in our Christian treatment of each other! The slaves prove not the only contraband article. The spirit of sect gets no pass over the line. Orthodox and heterodox mix up in glorious union. In camp life, the shibboleth of sectarianism is unknown. This is progress in the direction of that unity for which Christ prayed, that his disciples might all be one. If the claim is valid that there are disciples of the Master who fight for dominion, then the war is a faithful school.
It really, however, seems sad that a lessen so current in all the pages of the Testament can only be mastered in the school of war. A poor comment is here afforded to the Labors of the thousand " legates from the skies," that Christian union should reveal itself only in time of carnage and blood. If soldiers in the camp can joyfully sing one song, pray cannot the soldiers of the Cross thus sing and love in union when at the Lord's altar? We will not be overmuch critical, but rather rejoice that unity of spirit is deemed essential even by soldiers in the army.
Is it said, this is being thankful for small favors? Not at all. Religious creeds, based on the dogmas of the church, amount to but little as tests of character. Men and women believe enough-perhaps too much. But in making an application of what is assented to comes the trial. The war has thus far proved to be eye-salve in clearing the vision respecting the hairsplitting of theological belligerents.
Another glance cheers us with the thought that geographical distinctions vanish away. A man's a man for his worth in duty. The spirit of caste is also contraband. The soldier does not hunt up the birthplace of his comrade to measure his worth. An Irishman is as good as a Yankee, if he prove faithful. So, then, the world does move. To learn the simple truths of righteousness may cost a treasure of blood and intense suffering; and if we are too depraved and stupid to profit by any other process, we must welcome this. God pity us for our folly, and save us from our darkness!
Milford, Dec. 16, 1861. G. W. S.
THE BEAUFORT NEGROES.
We think that enough tears have been shed over the pilfering and other "outrages" of the negroes at Beaufort, who are said to have gutted some of their masters' house after the latter had shot several of them, and deserted the rest. True, it was a sad exhibition of human depravity for those ignorant slaves to rob and defile the mansions of such high-born rebels as Barnwell Rhett and Gen. Drayton! But have we not bemoaned it about long enough? Would it not be better for our officers at Port Royal to cease denouncing the blacks, and look after their rebel masters awhile? Two weeks have elapsed since Com. Dupont cleared away the obstacles to a landing for bur troops, and the only thing we have heard from that quarter since is, that Gen. Sherman sent his proclamation ten miles into the interior by the hands of a lieutenant and a surgeon, who tried to force it upon a rebel clergyman, who wouldn't take it, but who finally consented to deliver it to another clergyman, who claimed to be a British subject-the lieutenant assuring all persons whom he met that the outrages perpetrated at Beaufort were committed by negroes. How sad it was that Sambo and Coffee should have abused the confidence of Mr. Rhett and Gen. Drayton during their absence!
It was supposed that Gen. Sherman went to South Carolina to fight the most desperate gang of parricides that ever took up arms against their country. Secretary Cameron assures us that, to meet the peculiar exigencies of that latitude, he had given the commander of the expedition authority to employ the slaves in any manner he should deem most advantageous, " whether in squads, companies or otherwise," and for this purpose he had sent a large extra supply of arms. Yet, so far from resorting to this element of strength, our officers seem to be sniveling over the lawless condition of the Beaufort negroes, who have simply followed the example of their masters in rebellion and robbery, though on a much smaller scale. The country had high hopes of Gen. Sherman. Sherman's battery had won an enviable fame. Squeamishness towards slavery, and the suavity of a dancing master towards rebels who are prating about black flags, were not supposed to be among his distinguishing traits. Bloodshed and victory, without mouthing or compunction, were hopefully looked for from him. They have not come yet, and the promise is not flattering, if slavery is to be treated after this gingerly fashion. Gen. Sherman might, ere this, have had five thousand able-bodied negroes drilling or laboring in his camp, if he had acted upon the authority placed in his hands. Yet, in a county which had six loyal blacks to one rebel white man, he seems to have nothing to do but to hedge himself with earth-works, and bewail the bad conduct of the Beaufort slaves.-Chicago Tribune.
One of the most remarkable features of the new life in South Carolina is afforded by the negroes. Black servants have been hired by many of the officers, as waiters, washermen and women. Black gangs have worked on the shore, or been used as oarsmen; blacks have served as scouts and guides in the reconnaissance's. Crowds of the women and children may be seen in various parts of the camps, but especially near headquarters, where they inhabit their old huts still. There they receive their rations, there they build fires to cook their food or do their washing, and cluster into odd-looking groups, picturesque for all their squalor. The men and boys join them at night, and always, after supper, in a dilapidated outhouse, is held a prayer-meeting. I listened outside, last night, and heard ardent ejaculations of thanksgiving for the favorable chance God had given to " my colored burden The jargon was absurd, but it was earnest; the singing was out of tune and time, but it was fervent In some quarters, the blacks are less religions, and held a ball to celebrate the coming of the Yankees. I have talked with nearly half of those I have seen; have asked them which they preferred, the new or the old order of things; and though some few here and there spoke kindly of their old masters, there was no mistaking the genuineness of their gratitude for the change.
At Beaufort, where not a few seemed sad at the pillaging that had occurred, yet even these declared they had long prayed for our coming. They laughed at the idea of our injuring them, which all declared their masters had endeavored to instill. The fact that they receive pay for their labor seems especially to delight them; and as for comfort many have told me that they never lived so well before. None evince a vindictive spirit; even those who speak of having been whipped often and severely are by no means indignant; but, on the other hand, those who seem to have been most kindly treated, evince no regret for their old condition. Two or three, perhaps half a dozen, were undoubtedly found armed at Beaufort, but no other indications of a warlike disposition have been detected. The determination of all who can escape to leave their master is, however, continually asserted. So far as the slaves are concerned, an advance into the country from Hilton Head would undoubtedly be followed by an immediate rush of the whole population toward our camps. I doubt whether they would be guilty of greater atrocities than those of pillage, unless the whites should madly provoke them, or insist upon the slaves following. Centuries of bondage have had their effect; and the spirit of the race is effectually cowed; they are not savages, but slaves.
DEFENSES OF WASHINGTON. According to the report of the Chief Engineer of the Army-General Barnard-made to the Secretary of War, there are forty-eight defensive works around and in close vicinity to Washington, which mount three hundred guns that defend a circumference of thirty-five miles-exceeding by several miles, in this respect, the perimeter of the largest fortification of modern times.
<c04>CHANGE IN A BRITISH ORGAN. The British Review, which was formerly intensely hostile to our government, has lately turned the other way. It has six elaborate article, showing the mistake and folly of secession, which closes as follows:-
"The Federal Union, let us add, as a concluding consideration for Southern politicians, has a potential voice in the politics of the world. It has lifted itself up against Great Britain; it has challenged France, and obtained its own terms; it has taught Austria to respect American citizens; it is quite on a level with the empire of Russia; it has subdued Mexico; it extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific; thirty-one millions of strong and intelligent people constitute a great nation. The secession of the South, followed by other secessions incited by pernicious example, may break into fragments this now powerful, free and most valuable member of the community of the civilized world; but the South never can inherit its power. What great nation will ever care a straw for anything thought, said or done by an almost shipless community on the Gulf of Mexico, the sinews of which are negro slaves? Secession is not the road to empire, but to insignificance and ruin."
OUR MULATTO VICE PRESIDENT. The Memphis Avalanche has an article on the "mulatto" President of the North. It remarks:-"We have only been able to account for the remarkable lukewaness of Hannibal Hamlin in regard to the Abolition war, by attributing it to the general distrust of Abolition sincerity entertained by his race. With a decided infusion of African blood in his veins,-a fact never yet successfully controverted-we may suppose that he shares the sentiments and feelings of his African kin. Neither is it improbable that an instinctive sense of the incongruity and impropriety of an individual of negro extraction ruling over white people induces his reticence and modesty. Every well-bred negro or mulatto would shrink from such an anomalous position as unbecoming; and Hannibal may be supposed to be well-bred, having received an education superior to that usually bestowed on free mulattoes."
Among the facts ascertained by our troops in their scouting expeditions from Port Royal is the following: that the contrabands are far more numerous than has hitherto been believed. They exist in great numbers in every direction. On St. Helena Island alone, on the plantations of Jenkins and Coffin, about two thousand were employed; half or three-quarters of that number, it is estimated, still remain. They are living on the provisions which were left by their masters; they also endeavor to dispose of it to parties of our troops who sometimes land there.
It is estimated that by far the greater portion of the blacks employed on extensive plantations yet remain. Many, of course, followed their masters; others are within our lines. But those who take care of themselves have very peculiar ideas of their own independence, and even of their proprietary rights. When asked where their masters are, they reply, with much gusto, that they have none; that they are their own masters; " Massa left when de Yankees come; dey run away when old white neck (the Wabash) sent de hotten shot."
The negroes represent themselves as the legal owners of all the live stock, sweet potatoes, and every description of provisions or available means which have been left in their possession by their masters. They suppose they have the best of whatever right of ownership may now exist. They (those yet on the plantations) are doing no work, living on such provisions as they can find, and sell quantities to our troops.
A letter from Hilton Head says the negroes who come in all express a desire to be free, and work for themselves. They all complain of harsh treatment by their masters. On Mr. Seabrook's plantation, a child had been taken by the master from almost every family, in the hope of inducing the rest to follow. On one plantation, a negro was found who had been shot, and left lying in the fire-place, nearly burnt to a cinder-a fact which rendered the story of the others highly probable.
 A contraband at Beaufort thus describes the flight of the rebels: " Fust de Alabamians run, den de Georgia cavalry went after dem, and dey didn't come back, den de Souf Carolinians run, and lef de Dutch to be killed." The Germans manned their guns.
General Drayton, in a letter to the Governor of South Carolina, says the negroes are behaving well, and while he admits that the negroes of a few plantations were insubordinate, he says:-
"I would respectfully advise that all planters and overseers, who are not mustered into service, and are owners or agents of property upon the main land, should, without delay, return to their several neighborhoods, and thus by their presence prevent a recurrence of that excitement among their people which has been due in a great measure to their absence."
The Philadelphia Inquirer thus relates how a naval officer "caught a Tartar":-
"A naval officer was so unfortunate, a day or two since, while enjoying his dinner at Willard's Hotel, as to denounce what he was pleased to term' Abolition movements, ' and to add that 'that Abolitionist Henry Wilson is as had as any of them.' To his surprise, a gentleman who had been quietly dining at his side, said in firm tones:' Sir I am Senator Wilson of Massachusetts, and I will suggest that you had perhaps better confine yourself to your duties, instead of indulging in such personal criticisms, which are in bad taste. The rebuked officer' shut pan, and soon left the table, to wait for the Senator in the hall, and humbly apologise for his remark."
SMART HITS. Rev. Mr. Manning, in his lecture at Institute Hall, recently, referred to Messrs. Mason and Slidell as Commodore Wilkes's " contrabands." He also referred to Mason as the vindictive persecutor of John Brown, and said, that while the gathering hosts of Freedom were chanting on the Potomac, "John Brown's soul is marching on," the Virginia Senator, under the shadow of Bunker Hill, at Fort Warren, whines out, dolefully, " O carry me back to Old Virginny."-Roxbury Journal.
EDWIN CROSWELL, for many years the editor of the Albany Argus, the leading Democratic paper in New York, has published a letter, in which he fully endorses the position taken by Col. John Cochrane, on the question of emancipating the slaves, as enunciated in his recent speech. We have now upon the record the views of the leading Democrats of the country, such men as Bancroft, Butler, Cochrane, Croswell, Dix, Dickinson, and other prominent men of the party, whose names we do not recollect, all of whom concur in the sentiment, that the confiscation of the slaves, and their employment by the Government against its enemies, is the proper method to end the rebellion, and the only one which will squelch it speedily and effectively.
New Orleans, at this season of the year, was formerly the scene of joyous life, brilliant gaiety large business, and a " Rialto where merchants most do congregate" from all parts of the world. Now, its situation under the blight of secession is vividly painted by the Albany Journal, with its levee deserted-ships rotting by the river side-storehouses abandoned to the rate-shope at noonday son Canal and St. Charles streets-the grass cropping from the chinks of the pavements. Nothing "doing "-no vessels coming in or going out-nobody having money-nobody paying his debts. And then every thing is so aristocratically dear! Pork 845 per barrel; lard 45 cents per pound; bacon 35 and 40 cents per pound; and no potatoes in the market. In addition to this, crime rampant-drunkenness and licentiousness putting public decency to the blush-a hostile fleet a few hours distant, threatening to destroy the city. So early and so terrible have been the fruits of treason ripened!
Commodore Levy, owner of the Monticello estate in Virginia, has prepared his will, in which he leaves the Jefferson homestead, and $100,000 to keep it in repair, as a legacy to the United States.
On Saturday, 7th instant, 2500 men passed through Nashville for Bowling Green, carrying black flags embellished with a skull and cross-bones. They were mostly sixty days men, armed entirely with shot guns.
In the New York regiment of Col. S. Wallace Cone, there are no less than three companies of soldiers composed wholly of members in Baptist churches. The Colonel himself is a son of the late Rev Dr. Spencer H. Cone, of New York.
Cruelty to wives is cheap in Iowa. William Hartwell, of North McGregor, in a fit of passion, recently seized his wife, stripped her of her clothing, and hold her upon the stove until her body was burnt to a crisp in places. He was fined only $100 for this savage conduct.

No. 31 WINTER STREET,
Where she will attend to all diseases of the Hair.
She is sure to cure in nine cases out of ten, as she has for many years made the hair her study, and is sure there are none to excel her in producing a new growth of hair.
Her Restorative differs from that of any one else,, being made from the roots and herbs of the forest.
She Champoos with a bark which does not grow in this country, and which is highly beneficial to the hair before using the Restorative, and will prevent the hair form turning grey.
She also another for restoring grey hair to its natural color in nearly all cases. She is not afraid to speak of her Restoratives in any part of the world, as they are used in every city in the country. They are also packed for her customers to take to Europe with them, enough to last two or three years, as they often say they can get nothing abroad like them.
